         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO Thee, O Saviour of Souls, according to my Duty and Deſire, do I Conſecrate this Work. It came from Thee, and it ought to return to Thee. And in Offering it to Thee,<note place="margin">Paral. <hi>29.</hi>
               </note> I reſtore a thing which by all manner of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles appertains to Thee. They are Thy Divine Words which are here us'd, and thoſe with which Thou waſt pleas'd to inſpire one of Thy greateſt Servants. Thy Grace hath aſſiſted me to Compoſe them by particular Aids which I have receiv'd from Thee in this ſmall Labor. That fervent Zeal which Thou waſt pleas'd ſo frequently to manifeſt for the Salvation of young Souls, when Thou waſt upon Earth, hath given Birth to this Deſign; and the Hope I had of Thy Succor, hath given me the Confidence to undertake it. Let not my Miſery ſtop the Effects of Thy Bounty, nor hinder Thy pious Inſtructions from producing in Souls the Fruit they ought to bring forth. Divine <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S!</hi> Animate with Thy Holy Spirit the Words of this Book. Cauſe them for whom it is made, in Reading it, to acknowledge the ſtrict Obligations they have to Serve Thee, and the earneſt Deſire thou haſt of their Salvation. Speak to their Hearts at the ſame time
<pb facs="tcp:33523:4"/>that theſe Letters inform their Eyes, and inſpire them by the Motions of Thy Grace, with the Documents they ſhall here find for their Salvation. It behoveth Thee now rather than at any other time, to make the Effects of Thy Mercy appear upon young Souls. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus faciendi Domine,</hi>

Let not the Souls be loſt which thou haſt Redeem'd with Thy precious Blood, and for the Salvation of whom Thou haſt teſtifi'd ſo great Love. Reſerve them for Thy Service; Hinder them from bending their Knees before <hi>Baal,</hi> and from being deſtroy'd by the Infection of this perverſe Age. Make that Zeal which Thou hadſt for the Salvation of Youth, revive in Thy Prieſts; and grant me the Grace, which I moſt humbly beg, to be able to employ faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully therein, my Pains and Labors for Thy Glory.</p>

            <head>The <hi>PREFACE</hi> to the READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Book, dear Reader, hath no great need of a Preface; and if I give you one here, it is only to tell you that I had no Deſign to make it. Prefaces are neceſſary to advertiſe the Reader, either of the Deſign of the Author, or of the Occaſion which gave beginning to the Work, or of the Order and Method that is obſerv'd therein, or of the Profit that may be reap'd, or of ſome ſuch like thing. As for my Deſign, it is no other than what the Title of the Book doth bear, <hi>viz.</hi> To inſtruct Youth in Piety. This is all my Aim and Pretence. The Occaſion which made me undertake it was, becauſe being call'd to the Conduct of Youth, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd to make my ſelf capable of ſo important an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and correſpond with the pious Intentions of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany which gave me the Honor of that Charge. Now in laboring to Inſtruct my ſelf, I found that what I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for my ſelf, might ſerve for the Inſtruction of Youth, if it were reduc'd into Method: And this alſo might be moſt uſeful to me, becauſe it is moſt certain, that the beſt way to Learn, is to Teach. I have therefore diſpos'd of it into the Method you ſee, wherein I treat of Five things, which ſeem'd to me neceſſary to give young People an entire Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Piety, <hi>viz. 1.</hi> The Motives which oblige them thereto. <hi>2.</hi> The Means they ought to employ to obtain it. <hi>3.</hi> The Obſtacles and Difficulties which occur therein. <hi>4.</hi> The Vertues which are proper for it. <hi>5.</hi> The Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of making a good Choice of a State of Life, and the
<pb facs="tcp:33523:5"/>Means to perform it as one ought. Which is a Subject lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle known amongſt young People, and leſs practis'd.</p>
            <p>As to the Profitableneſs of this Book, dear Reader, it is not my Part, but yours to judge of it. The End for which it is Compos'd, which is the Inſtruction of Youth, will make you eſteem it uſeful. The Matter of it, which is chiefly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Sacred Scripture and Fathers, will cauſe you to make the ſame Judgment. If the Method I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſeem eaſie to you, it will give the final Deciſion.</p>
            <p>In fine, I Write for young People: For them have I Compos'd this Work, and particularly for them whom God hath pleas'd to commit to my Conduct. If others more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in Age take the pains to Read it, I deſire they would peruſe it with the Spirit of Charity, excuſing what they find defective in it, and receiving kindly what they ſhall find good. But you, dear Reader, for whom I Write, I exhort you to advantage your ſelf by this ſmall Labor which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, for your Salvation. I call you in this Inſtruction by the Name of <hi>Theotime,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Honor of God;</hi> becauſe I conſider you in that State, or at leaſt in the Will to arrive there. Read it then with this Spirit and Deſire. Read it to be inſtructed therein concerning your Salvation, and to learn therein betimes what you are to do during the whole courſe of your Life, that is, to Serve him to whom you ow all. And laſtly, that you may receive a certain and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd Profit, I demand of you Two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That you Read it with three Conditions; With a deſire to Learn, With Attention, And in Order, that is, one Part after another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That you would conſider, that it is not I who ſpeak to you, but God, by the Divine Inſtructions he hath given us in the Sacred Scripture, and in the Writings of the holy Fathers. Read it therefore with all the Reſpect which is due to that adorable Maſter; and in theſe Sacred Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſearch for true Wiſdom, without which all the reſt is
<pb facs="tcp:33523:5"/>but Folly. Happy are you if you ſearch it as you ought, and if you can one-day ſay with one of the wiſeſt of Mortals, That you have ſearch'd for Wiſdom during your Youth,<note place="margin">Eccl. 5.</note> and that having ſeriouſly apply'd your ſelf to the Enquiry, have found it, and made progreſs therein, you will, as he did, give all the Glory to God, who is the Author thereof. <hi>Danti mihi ſapientiam dabo gloriam;</hi> And you will receive the Advantage, which will continue with you for all Eternity.</p>

                     <p>AMongſt all the things whoſe Knowledg is neceſſary for Man,<note place="margin">The End for which Man is Created, is his firſt neceſſary Knowledg.</note> that which firſt and before all he ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, is the End for which he is plac'd in this World. Becauſe, being a Reaſonable Creature, he ought to act for a final End, in the Enjoyment whereof he ſeeks his Happineſs and Felicity. Now he cannot
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33523:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>act for this End, without a Knowledg of it, which raiſes in him a Deſire, makes him ſearch and employ Means to arrive there. A Man who knows not his laſt End, is ſcarce diſtinct from a Beaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he regards only things preſent, things material, and ſenſible, after the manner of Bruits, and in this is more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable than they; inaſmuch as they find in theſe material things the Felicity they are capable of: And he, inſtead of finding his Repoſe, encounters with nothing but Diſguſts, and the Source of a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>From the ignorance of this laſt End ſpring all the Diſorders and Corruption of Mens Lives; becauſe forgetting their heavenly Beginning, and the noble and divine End for which their Creator had deſtin'd them, they abſolutely ſtop at the enjoyment of the Pleaſures of this mortal Life, without raiſing their thoughts or deſires higher, living upon Earth as if they were made for the Earth.</p>
                     <p>And as it would be a thing which would move compaſſion, to ſee a Child born of Royal Blood, ordain'd by his Birth one day to wear a Crown and Scepter, being bred up amongſt Peaſants, ignorant of his Extraction, to apply himſelf wholly to Till the Earth, to bound all his Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within the Limits of getting a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Livelihood with the Sweat of his Brow, without having the leaſt thought of the high Fortune for which he was born:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33523:11"/>So it is a thing much to be deplor'd, to ſee Men who are the Children of Heaven, deſtinated by God to reign there eternally with him, live in an entire forgetfulneſs of that End, for which they are Created, and ſetting all their Affection upon Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, miſerably deprive themſelves of that Beatitude which the Bounty of their Creator hath prepared for them.</p>
                     <p>For this Reaſon, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> reſolving to exhort you to embrace Vertue in your Youth, I propoſe unto you firſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things, what you are, and the End for which you are Created, to baniſh that ſo common and dreadful a forgetfulneſs amongſt Men, that knowing your laſt End, you may ardently aſpire to it, and begin betimes to perform what lies in you to make you worthy, and arrive there.</p>
                     <p>Recollect your thoughts then,<note place="margin">Reflection upon Three things.</note> dear Child, and reflect upon Three things: Who you are, Who made you what you are, And for what End.</p>

Doth not this ſo noble a Soul which God hath beſtow'd on you, endow'd with Underſtanding, Will, and Memory, capable to know all things, clearly manifeſt that you were created for a higher and more honourable End? Doth not this Figure of the Body you bear, the Stature erect, the Head on high, and Eyes rais'd towards Heaven, (a Figure oppoſite to that of Beaſts, which looks only upon the Earth) teach you that you are not made for the Earth?</p>

                     <p>You were not then made for Creatures, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> but for the Creator. Your laſt End is not the enjoyment of Created things, but of God himſelf.

                     <p>AFTER the precedent Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Three Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Men to Serve God in their Youth.</note> I paſs to others yet more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to convince you of the moſt ſtrict Obligation you have to Conſecrate your ſelf to God in your Youth. The firſt which I advance is, That God earneſtly deſires to be Serv'd by you in that Age, and that the Service of young People is particularly agreeable to him. I ſhall make clear this Truth by Three Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt Reaſon.</note> Becauſe the Time of Youth is the Beginning of Life. Now it is certain, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all things God demands particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Firſt and Beginnings. He ordain'd for this reaſon in the ancient Law, that the Firſt-fruits of all things that grew ſhould be Offer'd to him: He would have amongſt the Fruits, the Firſt that was gather'd to be Preſented to him; Amongſt Beaſts, the Firſt to be Offer'd in Sacrifice to him; And amongſt Men, the Eldeſt Sons to be Preſented in his Temple to Serve there, permitting them afterwards to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; ſhewing by this Inſtitution, that altho' all things did equally appertain unto him, yet he had a ſpecial Eſteem for the Firſt, as thoſe which above all others were due unto him, and which he requir'd in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33523:18"/>Title of Acknowledgment. Whence it evidently follows, That the Time of Youth being the beginning and firſt part of our Life, God demands it particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and would have it Preſented unto him, to be faithfully Employ'd in his Service.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Second Reaſon.</note> The Time of Youth is moſt pleaſing to God, becauſe properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to the natural Order of things, it is the moſt innocent part of Life, and leaſt corrupted by Sin: Becauſe in that Time one has not ſo full a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Evil, nor ſo much ability, and occaſion to perform it: Ones Judgment is not prejudicated by the falſe Maxims of the World, nor his Manners, nor Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deprav'd by the Infection of the Wicked. Beſides, the Grace receiv'd in Baptiſm being yet freſh, renders that Age more agreeable to God, at leaſt in the Perſon of thoſe, who by a Life full of Sin, trample not under their Feet that Grace, and Robe of Innocence.</p>
                     <p>But take notice, <hi>Theotime,</hi> I have ſaid, That that Age is leſs corrupted, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, and according to the natural Order of things; yet it is but too true, that many times much Corruption is found therein; but this againſt the Order Nature hath eſtabliſh'd, which hath given to that Age for its Portion, a Simplicity of Mind, and Innocence of Manners; and thoſe are ſo much more culpable, who by their Malice and Depravation, corrupt what Nature had render'd as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33523:19"/>to it, learning Wickedneſs, and running after it, in an Age where Nature her ſelf taught nothing but Simplicity and Innocence.</p>
                     <p>The Third Reaſon which declares that God particularly deſires to be Serv'd by you in your Youth,<note place="margin">Third Reaſon.</note> dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> is, That it is the Time where you have the moſt occaſion to make appear that you love God ſincerely: For it is the Time of the firſt Temptations, wherein you begin to be mov'd to renounce his Love, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. You are tempted by your own Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which are then in their prime vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Invited by thoſe of your Age, who often ſolicit you to Wickedneſs, either by their Example or by their Diſcourſe: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the Enemy of your Salvation, who uſes all his Endeavours to withdraw you from the Service of God, and ſecure himſelf quickly of your Perſon. So that this Time may properly be call'd the Time of Combat, and Trial; wherein you ſhew you love God with a conſtant and real Affection, if you couragiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt thoſe firſt Aſſaults.<note n="*" place="margin">Gubernator in tempeſtate dignoſcitur, in acie miles probatur.

Cypr. lib. de Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate.</hi>
                        </note> It is but a ſmall thing to be Generous in Time of Peace, to have Courage when one is not Attackt, not to commit Wickedneſs when one is not Tempted; But to reſiſt Evil, and fly from Sin in the Time of Temptation, and in the Age where one finds the greateſt danger of being ruin'd, is a real Proof of true Vertue, and an aſſur'd Mark that one loves God above all things.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Reaſons, <hi>Theotime,</hi> make appear, that God hath a ſpecial Affection for the Service of young Perſons, which being employ'd in the flight of Sin, and Service of God, are the moſt agreeable that can be Offerd unto him. And, as a Learned Author ſays excellently well,<note n="*" place="margin">Qui hac aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſe domant, &amp; Deo ſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciant, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Deo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiam viven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, Deo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centem, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculatam. <hi>Hugo à Sanct.

This Verity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33523:20"/>is no leſs certain than the former; See how I Prove it.</p>
                  <p>God is pleas'd with his Favours parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to aſſiſt Thre ſorts of Perſons; The <hi>Weak,</hi> The <hi>Simple,</hi> that is, thoſe who have leaſt knowledg of Evil; And the <hi>Humble.</hi> The <hi>Weak,</hi> becauſe there the force of his Grace doth moſt appear.<note n="a" place="margin">Deus non projiciet Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicem, nec porriget ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Malignis. <hi>Job</hi> 8.</note> The <hi>Simple,</hi> becauſe having leſs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Evil, they ordinarily put the leaſt Impediments to the Grace of God, who, as the Sacred Scripture ſays,<note n="b" place="margin">Cum Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicibus Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocinatio ejus. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Rejects not the Simple, as he ſtretcheth not out his Hand to aſſiſt the Wicked.</hi> The <hi>Humble,</hi> becauſe as the chief Obſtacle of the Grace of God is <hi>Pride,</hi> ſo the beſt Diſpoſition to obtain it, is <hi>Humility,</hi> according to that Saying of Scripture,<note n="c" place="margin">Deus ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis reſiſtit, humilibus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem dat grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. <hi>Jacob.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>God reſiſts the Proud, and gives Grace to the Humble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe Three Qualities ordinarily occur in Youth; There is found in Youth the moſt Weakneſs, not only of Body but Mind, the Judgment not being as yet well form'd by Knowledg and Experience, nor the Will ſufficiently fix'd againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions contrary to its Good. There is in Youth more Simplicity, having leſs knowledg of Evil, and leſs diſcernment than in a more advanc'd Age. There is alſo in Youth more Humility, which is as it were natural to that Age, which is fram'd to be Subject and Obey; and if Pride be found, as it happens but too often, in young Minds, it is by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Corruption, which ſubverts the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33523:20"/>Order of things, and deſtroys Nature her ſelf. Hence it manifeſtly follows, That God, who is delighted to make his Bounty appear towards thoſe who have moſt need of it, and render not themſelves undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, is pleas'd to communicate many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to young People, and to cheriſh them with good Thoughts and Deſires, and all other Aſſiſtances of his Grace, when they oppoſe not him by their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life, and make not themſelves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, by corrupting the Innocence of their Age with the malice of their Mind, and by the multitude of their Sins.</p>
                  <p>For Confirmation of this Truth, there needs no other Teſtimony than Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which makes it appear moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly. Alas! <hi>Theotime,</hi> how many are there, who advancing forward out of Youth, find in themſelves a great Change, not being partakers any more of ſo many Favours as they receiv'd in their Youth? Then holy Inſpirations were frequent, good Deſires, and pious Reſolutions were familiar to them; they had an averſion and apprehenſion of Evil, Goodneſs was agreeable to them, Vertue was ſweet and facil to them. But now they find that all theſe things are chang'd; Inſpirations more rare, Sin cauſes in them a leſs hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; Devotion becomes cold, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times totally extinct, by a ſad alteration, which makes them with much reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the Time paſt, and Favours loſt, which thoſe Words of <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Quis mihi tribuat ut ſim juxta menſes priſtinos, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum dies quibus Deus cuſtodiebat me, ſicut ſui in diebus ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcentiae meae quando erat omnipotens mecum. <hi>Job</hi> 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Who will

                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> did very notably Experience this Change in his own Perſon, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowledges in his Confeſſions; for he ſaith, That being<note n="a" place="margin">Vidiſti Deus meus! quo motu animi &amp; quâ fide ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſmum Chriſti tui, Dei &amp; Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni mei flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavi a pietate matris meae &amp; matris omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Eccleſiae tuae. <hi>Aug. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Confeſ. c.</hi> 19.</note> faln into a Sickneſs when he was yet a young Youth, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Baptiſm with very great Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Devotion, which was deferr'd him for ſome particular Reaſons.<note n="b" place="margin">Neque deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derabam in illo tanto pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculo baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum tuum, &amp; melior eram puer, quando illum de materna pietate flagitavi, ſicut jam recordatus &amp; confeſſus ſum. <hi>Ibid. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.</note> And that in another great Diſtemper which he had about Thirty Years of Age, he never thought of asking for it. O <hi>Theotime,</hi> I beſeech God that this Change and Sorrow never befall you: But it happens to many, and ſhews clearly the Love God bears to young Perſons, and the Favours he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon them, which he doth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from them, but when they contemn them, and make themſelves unworthy.</p>
                  <p>But if you will yet have a convincing and demonſtrative Proof of the particular Love God bears young People, conſider what the Son of God did upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whilſt he was in the World. Beſides that he would become himſelf a Child, and paſs thro' all the Degrees of Age, of Infancy, of Childhood, of Youth, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to diſpence with himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a perfect Man from his firſt Entrance

                  <p>The Second is that dreadful Menace which he afterwards utter'd againſt thoſe that Scandalize the Little Ones, that is, who make them fall into any Sin.<note place="margin">Qui autem ſcandalizave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unum de puſillis iſtis qui in me cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt, expedit ei ut ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur mola aſinaria in collo ejus, &amp; demergatur in profundum maris. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</note>

                  <head type="sub">That they who Conſecrate not themſelves to God in their Youth, offer him a moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Injury.</head>
                  <p>THIS Truth evidently follows out of the Two former;<note place="margin">Fifth Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Serve God in Youth.</note> for if it be true as we have manifeſted, That God deſires and demands particularly the Service of young People, and hath an extream Love for that Age, on which he beſtows very ſingular Favours to aſſiſt it, and invite it to his Service; It follows,<note place="margin">The Injury that is done to God by not Serving him in that Age</note> That to refuſe him the Service he deſires, and requires with ſo much Juſtice, and not to anſwer the Love he teſtifies to Youth by ſo many Favours and Benefits, is to offer him a moſt heinous and enormous Affront. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Verity is of ſuch Conſequence, that it can never be ſufficiently inculcated, I ſhall make you ſee it more diſtinctly by the Three following Conſiderations, which I beſeech you to Examine well.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt Reaſon of this Injury.</note> Not to Conſecrate the Time of Youth to the Service of God, is to take away a certain and aſſured Time, which you may give him, to reſerve him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, which you are not ſure to have, and which is not in your power, <hi>viz.</hi> the Time to come. This is the Firſt Degree of the Injury you offer to God. You pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe God to Serve him when you are older. Who hath told you that you ſhall live a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33523:23"/>long time? If you are not certain to be alive to Morrow, how are you ſure to live Ten Years hence? There are more who die before Twenty or Twenty five Years of Age, than after. Now if you have no aſſurance to live a long time, is it not a great Injury you do to God, to promiſe him the Time to come, which you have not, nor is in your power, and refuſe him the Time preſent, which you enjoy? What think you, <hi>Theotime,</hi> do's not he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride God, who acts in this manner? and doth he not evidently manifeſt that he hath no true Will to Serve him, deferring to Conſecrate himſelf to him in a Time which perhaps may never come?</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Second Reaſon.</note> You not only reſerve an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Time for God, but take away the better to give him the worſe. For refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Serve God, and apply your ſelf to Vertue in your Youth, which is, as we ſaid before, ordinarily leſs deprav'd by Vice, and moſt favour'd by Kindneſſes from God, you reſerve to your ſelf a Time wherein all things conſpire to hinder you, and render you unfit for Good, and the Exerciſe of Vertue. The Inconveniences of the Body which daily are caus'd, the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Vicious Habits wherein you will be Engag'd, the Perplexity of Worldly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the Solicitude of Temporal Things, the Spirit and Maxims of the World, which you have Embraced.<note place="margin">Totus mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus in malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no poſitus. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.</note> The World, which (as S. <hi>John</hi> ſays) is entirely plung'd in Vice and Corruption, which breaths
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33523:23"/>after nothing but Pleaſures, Covetouſneſs, Pride, and has no more thought of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eternity, than if there were no ſuch thing at all.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things will bring an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impediment to your Salvation, and will abſolutely divert you from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, if you prevent not them in good time, by applying your ſelf in your Youth to the Flight of Sin, and to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Vertue. Judge then of the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you do to God, deferring to Serve him in a Time where you ſhall have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hindrances, and not reſolving to Serve him another where you have ſo many Means and Advantages. Doubtleſs this is a grievous Injury; Yet this is not all, take notice of that which follows.</p>
                  <p>That which fully concludes the Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Injury offer'd to God, is,<note place="margin">Third Reaſon.</note> That not intending to Serve him in your Youth, you will give him nothing but the remainder of Sin, delaying to Serve him till after you have paſs'd your Time mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in your Youth, ſatisfy'd all your Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and follow'd the wicked Inclinations of your Age; So that the Time you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, is but the remnant of what you have employ'd in Sin, and Service of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Do you comprehend, <hi>Theotime,</hi> the heinouſneſs of this Injury, and the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with which you treat your God, and your Creator?<note n="*" place="margin">Neſcitis, quia Templum Dei eſtis, &amp; Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Dei habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat in vobis. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> Your Soul is made to be the Temple and Dwelling of God, and you will not allow it him, till after you
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33523:24"/>have a long time proſtituted it to the Devil for his Retiring-place, and after you have defil'd it with a vaſt number of Crimes. All your Life ought to be Conſecrated to the Service of God, and you will Employ the firſt and better Part in the Service of the Devil, reſerving to God only that which would be no more uſeful to Sin. Can there be an Indignity equal to this? What would you ſay of a Man that would Serve up to the Table of a Prince, nothing but the Remainders and Scraps of Dogs, and Swines-meat? This you would ſay were horrible; and have not you a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for the ſame thing, which you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form far more criminally towards God, keeping for his Service only the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of your Paſſions, which you have brutiſhly ſatisfy'd during your Youth?

If he lays a Curſe upon him who retains the better Part for himſelf, and Preſents the worſt to him in Sacrifice;<note place="margin">Maledictus doloſus qui habet in gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge ſuo maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, &amp; votum faciens immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat debile Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

I would to God we had not ſeen ſo many Effects of this Curſe of God upon many young People, as we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every Day, by dreadful Accidents, ſudden Deaths, rejecting of God, obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs in Vice, and many other Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which are the Effects of Thy juſt Choler, O Almighty God! by which Thou daily Puniſheſt thoſe who offer Thee this Injury, who forget Thee in their Youth to follow their wicked Inclinations, and who would not Serve Thee but after they had Serv'd Sin, their Paſſions, and the Devil.</p>

                  <head type="sub">How God hath an Averſion for wicked young People. Conſiderable Examples upon this Subject.</head>
                  <p>AFTER what we have ſaid,<note place="margin">Sixth Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vicious young Perſons.</note> there is no need of Proving this Propoſition, which is a neceſſary Conſequence from the Three former: For how can it be but that God ſhould have an extream Averſion for thoſe, who contemn the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he does them, in particularly deſiring their Service; who are not mov'd with the Love he bears them, and who on the contrary treat him with ſo much Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Contempt as we have ſhewn?
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33523:25"/>God hath an Averſion for all Sinners, as he himſelf hath ſaid;<note place="margin">Odio ſunt Deo impius &amp; impietas ejus. <hi>Sap.</hi> 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Averſor Impium, I deteſt the Wicked.</hi> But this Averſion is greateſt againſt thoſe, to whom he hath teſtify'd moſt Love and Benevolence, and who unworthily abuſe it. Love offended is chang'd into Indignation, and Bounty contemn'd and ill treated, becomes a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs Fury.</p>
                  <p>That this is ſo, beſides theſe Reaſons which clearly demonſtrate it, Experience makes it appear with undoubted Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the Effects which God frequently ſhews, of that Averſion he hath for vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous young People. I ſhall recount here Four very notable Examples, all taken out of the Sacred Scripture, that no one may doubt of them, and that from theſe one may give a Judgment of others.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Example is of the Two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Judas</hi> the Son of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob.</hi> This Man had Seven Children, the Two elder whereof were Wicked and Vicious. Behold what the Scripture ſaith of the Firſt,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>38.</hi>
                     </note> whoſe Name was <hi>Her; Fuit quoque Her nequam in conſpectu Domini &amp; ab eo occiſus eſt. Her,</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Judas, was wicked in the ſight of God, and his Life was taken away by him.</hi> And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after it is ſaid of the Second, nam'd <hi>Onan,</hi> that God ſtruck him with Death, for a Sin of Impurity which he had committed, which the Scripture in that place calls Deteſtable. <hi>Idcirco per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſit eum Dominus eo quod rem deteſtabilem
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33523:25"/>faceret; God ſtruck him with Death, becauſe he had done a deteſtable Action.</hi> This Sin, altho' deteſted by God himſelf, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis'd with ſo Exemplary a Puniſhment, by a deplorable Misfortune, is but too common amongſt Youth, upon which it draws the Divine Indignation either vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly or inviſibly.</p>
                  <p>The Second Example is of the Two Children of the High Prieſt <hi>Heli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.</note> call'd <hi>Ophni</hi> and <hi>Phinees.</hi> Theſe Two young Men were Employ'd by their Father in the Miniſtry of the Temple and Sacrifices, wherein they behav'd themſelves very ill, committing great Irrevrences in the Temple, and high Injuſtices towards the Faithful, who came to Offer their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to God, requiring from them, by an inſatiable Avarice, more than juſtly was their due: Inſomuch that the Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſays that they were the<note n="a" place="margin">Porro filii Heli filii Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial, neſcientes Dominum.</note> Children of <hi>Belial;</hi> ſo it calls thoſe whom it would ſignifie to be very wicked, and abſolutely ruin'd: For <hi>Belial</hi> is as much as to ſay, <hi>Abſque jugo,</hi> having loſt the Fear of God, and the remembrance of their Duty; and it adds that their<note n="b" place="margin">Erat ergo peccatum pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erorum gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de nimis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Domino.</note> Sin was very enormous in the ſight of God. Their Iniquity drew upon them ſo great an Indignation of God, that he ſent by a<note n="c" place="margin">Videbis ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulum tuum in Templo, in univerſis proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris Iſrael, &amp; non erit ſenex in domo tua omnibus diebus, pars magna domus tuae morietur cum ad viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem aetatem venerit.</note> Prophet to tell the Father, too negligent in Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Children, That he would take a Revenge which ſhould ſerve as an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all Poſterity; That he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Family from the High Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33523:26"/>to give to another; That the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his Offspring ſhould die in the Flower of their Youth, and ſhould not arrive at a perfect Age; And that his two Sons, <hi>Ophni</hi> and <hi>Phinees</hi> ſhould die both in one Day, and that all their Race ſhould<note n="d" place="margin">Juravi do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mui Heli quod non expietur iniquitas do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ejus, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimis &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neribus uſque in aeternum.</note> bear for ever the Marks of their Iniquity, which ſhould never be Expiated by Victims and Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>All this happen'd as he had foretold. A little while after <hi>Ophni</hi> and <hi>Phinees</hi> were kill'd in a Defeat of the <hi>Philiſtians.</hi> On the ſame Day the Father hearing the News of their Death, fell down back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, broke his Head, and dy'd upon the Place. Many other Misfortunes happen'd that Day, and amongſt others, the Ark of the Teſtament was taken by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; And all the reſt of the Prediction was fulfill'd a little after.</p>
                  <p>The Third Example is of <hi>Amnon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13.</note> the eldeſt Son of <hi>David.</hi> The Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts but one wicked Action of his, yet one ſo black and deteſtable, that it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuppoſes many others; it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a Man never aſcends on a ſuddain to the height of Impiety, and that great Crimes are the Effect of a Soul abandon'd by God for her precedent Sins. This young Prince having permitted his Heart to be overcome with unchaſt Love, lets himſelf be carry'd away in ſuch a manner, that this brutiſh Paſſion, which ordinarily moves to heinous Extremities, and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crimes, making him loſe the moſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33523:26"/>inviolable Laws of Nature, excited him to love unchaſtly his own Siſter; whereupon, when he could not obtain her Conſent to ſuch an abominable Propoſal, he adds Force to Paſſion, committing in one only Action two moſt enormous Crimes, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Inceſt.</p>
                  <p>But the Divine Juſtice did not wait long, before it made appear what a Horror it had for the Crimes and wicked Life of this young Prince: For, two Years after he was kill'd by his own Brother <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who had conceal'd this Revenge in his Heart all that time. O God, how terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are thy Judgments!</p>
                  <p>The Fourth, which is of <hi>Abſolom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13 <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.</note> the Third Son of <hi>David,</hi> who was no better than his Brother <hi>Amnon.</hi> He had a proud, diſſembling, revengeful, and highly am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Mind, having a mighty Eſteem for himſelf, and his own Beauty, which by report of Scripture was extraordinary. The firſt wicked Action which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture relates of him, but which muſt needs have been preceded by many others, is the Murther of his Brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> which was an abominable Crime. For this Action he was caſt out of his Father's Favour, and baniſh'd from him for the ſpace of five Years, after which he was recall'd, and admitted to his Favour again. He was ſcarce return'd to his Father's Court, when he begins to deviſe a famous Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt him: And having by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes gain'd the Affection of the People,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33523:27"/>he departs to a little Village, where he cauſes himſelf to be Proclaim'd King. After this he takes up Arms againſt his Father, conſtrains him to fly from the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and purſues him with a ſtrong Army, which he had rais'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of his Crown. What will the Divine Juſtice do here? Will it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the Wrongs of ſuch a degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Child? Hearken, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to what the Sacred Scripture relates. <hi>David</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf brought to ſuch Straits by his Son, was oblig'd to make Head againſt him, and oppoſe him. He ſets in order the ſmall Forces he had with him, ſends them to Fight, gives him Battel. <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>'s Men, tho' far more in number, are Defeated.</p>
                  <p>In this Diſcomfiture (O the Divine Judgments!) it happens that <hi>Abſolom</hi> endeavouring to ſave himſelf by Flight, was carry'd under a great Oak, and as he wore his Locks very long, his Hair by a ſtrange Accident, and particular Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, was ſo ſtrongly entangl'd in the Branches of the Tree, that the Mule he rode on could not carry him away, but continuing his Courſe, left him hanging by the Head, without being able to diſengage himſelf. <hi>David</hi>'s Soldiers ſeeing him in this Condition, came and ran him thro' with a Lance, and kill'd him immediately, altho' <hi>David</hi> by an incredible Bounty, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Battel, had expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them to offer any hurt to his Perſon.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:33523:27"/>
                  <p>O Divine Juſtice! Thou ſheweſt moſt clearly that Thou doſt not wink at the Iniquities of wicked Children; and altho' Thou deferreſt for a time the Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they deſerve, to give them leiſure to Repent, Thou afterwards puniſheſt moſt ſeverely their Obſtinacy in Sin, and the Affront they offer to Thy Goodneſs, with which Thou expecteſt their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>Behold, Four Examples out of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, which evidently manifeſt how God hath an Averſion for vicious young People; The ſame Scripture might furniſh us with many others. Ancient Hiſtories are all full, and daily Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence produces but too many Examples in theſe Times.</p>
                  <p>Take notice of one thing worthy of Conſideration;<note place="margin">An important Remark.</note> That in the Four prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Examples are contain'd Three forts of Sins, which render young People par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly odious to God, and which are the moſt ordinary Cauſes of their Ruine. In the Firſt and Third, the Sin of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In the Second, the Contempt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Holy Things; to which may be referr'd the Abuſe of Eccleſiaſtical Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices by young Incumbents, who many times draw upon themſelves and their Families, the Divine Malediction. In the Fourth, the Contempt of Parents, and Rebellion againſt Fatherly Authority.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That Salvation ordinarily depends on the Time of Youth.</head>
                  <p>WHAT we have ſaid in the Four laſt Chapters,<note place="margin">Seventh moſt important Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Vertue.</note> hath diſcover'd unto you the Obligation you have to Serve God in your Youth, by the Reſpect you owe to the Deſire he hath thereof, and for the Love he bears you. A Reſpect which you cannot reſiſt, without offering him a moſt heinous Injury, and incurring his Averſion and Diſpleaſure. Now I would make you know the ſame Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Intereſt of your Salvation, and ſhew you clearly, that your Salvation hath an extreme, and almoſt entire dependance on the Life you lead during your Youth.</p>
                  <p>I would to God, <hi>Theotime,</hi> you, and all thoſe of your Age, would comprehend well, and never forget this Truth, which is unknown to the greateſt part of Men, the ignorance whereof cauſes the Ruine and Damnation of many. I wiſh all Men underſtood, that the immenſe Eternity of Happineſs or Miſery, which expects them after this Life, depends upon this firſt Time, which all the World deſpiſes, and which the moſt part employs wickedly.</p>
                  <p>To convince you of this Verity, I ſhall produce the Sentiment of the Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that is, of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, who brings ſuch expreſs Teſtimonies, that it is impoſſible to doubt of it.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:33523:28"/>
                  <p>For why doth it in ſo many places advertiſe young People to think of their Salvation betimes, and to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Vertue in their Youth, except it were to ſhew, that <hi>that</hi> Time is a Time of great Importance for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
                  <p>Why doth it ſay in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi>

                        </gap>, and the ſad and diſcomfortable Years ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach?</hi> From whence comes it, that it aſſures us in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> That <hi>the</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Adoleſcens juxta viam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am etiam ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuerit, non recedet ab ea. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.</note> 
                     <hi>young Man ſhall continue even until his old Age in the Way he has once enter'd;</hi> that is, the manner of Life which he has begun? Wherefore doth it ſay by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> That <hi>it is</hi>

                  <p>Why in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> doth it exhort young People ſo powerfully to Vertue, by thoſe excellent Words, able to win the moſt inſenſible Hearts? <hi>Son,</hi>

                     <hi>receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from your Youth, and you ſhall find Wiſdom even to the end of your Life: Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto it as he who would Cultivate the Earth,</hi> that is, with Care and Labour, <hi>and expect the pleaſing Fruit which it will bring you. You will labour a little to obtain it, but ſoon after you will taſt of its admirable Fruits. 'Tis true, Vertue is hard and difficult, but it is only to thoſe who are inſenſible and vicious.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33523:29"/>But thoſe who have once known it well, find it pleaſing, and never part with it any more, and it will continue with them even to the laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of their Salvation in Eternal Glory.</hi> And all the reſt of that Chapter is but a continual Exhortation to young People to become Vertuous.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in the Twenty fifth Chapter doth it ſay,<note place="margin">Quae in juven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute tua non congregaſti quomodo in ſenectute tua invenies? <hi>Eccl.</hi> 25.</note> That it is impoſſible <hi>to find in old Age, what was not laid up in Youth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, Amongſt the Books of Sacred Scripture, why was there one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly made for the Inſtruction of Youth, which is that of <hi>Proverbs?</hi> Doth not all this manifeſtly diſcover that the Holy Ghoſt would give Men to underſtand, that the Time of Youth is of extream Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and the greateſt Part eſteem it not: And that all Happineſs and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Men, whether in this Life or in the next, depends ordinarily on that Time well or ill beſtow'd; It being commonly moſt certain, that thoſe obtain their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who in their Youth are bred up in the Fear of God, and Obſervation of his Commandments; And that thoſe who have not been Educated in that Fear of God, or who caſt it from before their Eyes, to follow Sin with more Liberty, do misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately Periſh.</p>
                  <p>All this Truth is rais'd from thoſe Two Foundations, whereof the Firſt is, That
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33523:29"/>thoſe who have follow'd Vertue in their Youth, continue eaſily therein all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their Life. And the Second, That on the contrary, thoſe who have given themſelves over to Sin, at that time do very hardly correct themſelves, and moſt frequently are never withdrawn. We ſhall diſcover theſe two Truths more amply in the following Chapters.</p>

                  <p>But when by the Succours of Divine Grace, which, as we have ſhewn above, are greater and more abundant in Youth, as the Temptations are more frequent and impetuous, one has gain'd the Victory in theſe firſt Encounters, it happens ſoon after, that with leſs difficulty he ſurmounts all the others which are to be undergone the whole Courſe of his Life,<note place="margin">Militia eſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta hominis ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per terram. <hi>Job</hi> 7.</note> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Sacred Scripture, is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Combat.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Proofs concerning the ſame Subject by notable Examples, taken out of Sacred Scripture, of thoſe who having been Vertuous in their Youth, have continu'd ſo all their Life; and chiefly of thoſe who have reſiſted in great Occaſions.</head>
                  <p>THE Firſt Example I ſhall produce,<note place="margin">Firſt Example, of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> Gen. <hi>37.</hi>
                     </note> is that of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was the Model of Vertue in his Youth. He being but Six Years of Age, hated Vice in ſuch a manner, that the wicked Example of his Brothers could never corrupt his Innocence; and on the contrary, not being able to endure their bad Deportment, he gave notice thereof to his Father <hi>Jacob.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Vertue, for which he was ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly favour'd by God, and tenderly lov'd by his Father, procur'd him the Enmity of his Brothers, even to ſuch a height, that they ſought nothing leſs than totally to deſtroy him. Having been one Day wandring in the Fields, they conſpir'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to murther him; but having a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to dip their Hands in his Blood, they reſolv'd to let him down into an old Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, with intent to permit him there to die. This poor Child not being able to overcome the Cruelty of his Brothers by his Prayers and Tears, was conſtrain'd to ſuffer it, putting all his Confidence in God, who never deſerts thoſe who love him.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33523:32"/>In this he was not deceiv'd; for his inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Brothers mov'd with the horror of ſo barbarous a Crime, chang'd their firſt Reſolution, and drawing their Brother out of the Ciſtern, reſolv'd to ſell him to Merchants, who then paſſed by; theſe carry'd him into Egypt, where he was ſold to a Lord of that Country. <hi>Joſeph</hi> being with his Lord, continu'd in his firſt Vertue, living in a perfect Innocence, by which he brought with him the Bleſſing of God upon the Houſe of his Maſter, who ſoon underſtood his Merit, and took a great Affection to him.</p>
                  <p>Behold how <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſpent the firſt part of his Youth, that is, until the Age of Twenty or Two and twenty years; and ſee what follows after that, and how he paſſes the reſt of his Life; wherein I take notice of Three remarkable Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where his Vertue was powerfully try'd.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt was about that Age where he receiv'd the moſt violent Attack that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity was ever able to undergo,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>39.</hi>
                     </note> being ſolicited by hy his Maſters Wiſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a deteſtable Adultery; but the Fear of God wherein he had been bred up, gave him ſuch a horror of that Crime, that all the Proſecution and Violence of that unchaſt Woman, could never ſtagger his Chaſtity, who ſince has ſerv'd as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all Ages.</p>
                  <p>From this Temptation he fell into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater: For this wicked Woman
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33523:33"/>not being able to compaſs her impious Deſign, accuſeth him for having attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Chaſtity, impoſing falſly upon him the Crime which ſhe her ſelf was guilty of. The Maſter provok'd with this Report, caus'd him to be bound and caſt into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where he continu'd until he was of the Age of Thirty years. This was a rude Temptation, and a Shock that might eaſily have overturn'd a Vertue of no long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to be accus'd and counted guilty of a Crime which he abominated, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Puniſhment for it as if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it. But <hi>Joſeph</hi> continues immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his firſt Vertue; and as he had learn'd Patience in his Youth by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of his Brothers, he ſuffer'd this with an admirable Meekneſs, comforting himſelf in the ſatisfaction of his Innocence, of which he had God for Witneſs and Protector: And God, who had always been with him, leaves him not on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; but as the Sacred Scripture ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">Deſcendit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que cum illo in foveam &amp; in vinculis non dereliquit eum, donec afferret illi Sceptrum reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni. <hi>Sap.</hi> 15.</note> he deſcended with him into the Ciſtern, aſſiſting him with his Grace, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully delivering him as he did preſently after.</p>
                  <p>To theſe two Trials ſucceeds the Third, yet greater. This was the high Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to which he was rais'd: For having Interpreted <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream by the Knowledge God gave him of Things to come,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>41.</hi>
                     </note> this King not only delivers him out of Priſon, but makes him the Chiefeſt of all his Kingdom, over which he gave
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33523:33"/>him a general Charge, with an abſolute Power to diſpoſe of all things according to his Will, and with a Command to all his Subjects to Obey him as himſelf. In this high Degree of Fortune, which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily dazles Mens Eyes, and where mean Vertues are loſt and quickly ruin'd, <hi>Joſeph</hi> remains firm in his former Vertue always like himſelf. The forgetfulneſs of God, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Revenge, which are accuſtom'd to attend upon high Fortunes, could never prevail upon his Mind. Having occaſion to revenge himſelf of his Brothers, who came into <hi>Egypt</hi> to make their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion during a ſevere Famine, he not only refuſes to do it, but receives them with ſuch Tenderneſs, and Teſtimonies of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as draw Tears from thoſe who read the Account the Scripture gives of it. He governs himſelf in his Charge with ſo much Juſtice,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>45.</hi>
                     </note> that never any made Complaint of his Conduct; And on the contrary, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly acknowledge him for their Deliverer being freed from Want during a Seven-years Famine, by his eminent Prudence, which purchas'd for him in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the Name of <hi>The Saviour of the World.</hi> He perſever'd thus in Vertue and Fear of God, in the midſt of his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs, from the Age of Thirty, when he was rais'd to that Fortune, even to the Age of an Hundred and ten, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he dy'd. O <hi>Theotime,</hi> reflect well upon this Example, and learn from it, what,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33523:34"/>a Vertue acquir'd in Youth is able to do.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould content my ſelf with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if that which follows were not alſo admirable to diſcover the ſame Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

                  </p>
                  <p>O the admirable Life, <hi>Theotime,</hi> of a young Man, who acted nothing Childiſh, that is, nothing contrary to Vertue; who permitted not himſelf to be carry'd away by the Torrent of ill Example, continuing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33523:34"/>in the Service of God, when all others withdrew themſelves from it. A Youth ſpent ſo vertuouſly, could not but be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by a perfect and a Saintly Life, as you ſhall ſee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Toby</hi> being come to Mans Age,<note place="margin">In captivitate poſitus viam veritatis non deſeruit.</note> was ſent into Captivity by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> with all his Country-men, to the City of <hi>Ninive:</hi> Being there, he departed not from the Path of Vertue which he had ſo happily enter'd in his Youth.</p>
                  <p>For Firſt,<note place="margin">Et cum ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ex cibis Gentilium, Ipſe cuſtodivit animam ſuam &amp; nunquam contaminatus eſt in eſcis eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> As he had learn'd in his Youth to reſiſt the wicked Examples of others, he permitted not himſelf to be corrupted in his Captivity by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Country-men, who eat licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the Meat of Gentiles, which the Law of God forbad them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Having receiv'd from the King of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> whoſe ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he had gain'd by the reputation of his Vertue, Permiſſion to go freely thro' all his Kingdom, he went to Viſit all thoſe who were in Captivity,<note place="margin">Pergebat er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gò ad omnes qui erant in captivitate &amp; monita Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis dabat eis.</note> and gave them Admoniſhments concerning their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Exhorting them to continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Service of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Affliction of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiv'd <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being become more ſevere, he daily went to Viſit and Comfort them, Diſtributed amongſt them what he was able to give them, Fed the Hungry, Cloth'd the Naked, and had a particular Care, with an unparallell'd Charity to Bury all the Dead he found, notwithſtanding the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33523:35"/>Diſpleaſure of the King, which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd by that Action, even to the danger of his Life. But what is yet more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, is the Patience with which he endur'd the moſt ſenſible Affliction of Blindneſs, which befell him by an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Accident in the Fifty ſixth Year of his Age. One Day as he return'd to his Houſe, weary'd with the Burial of many Dead, he chanc'd to fall aſleep under a Wall, from the top whereof the Dung out of a Swallows Neſt fell upon his Eyes, and took away his Sight. This was doubtleſs a very great Affliction, and a moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Trial; but he ſupported it with ſo admirable a Patience, that the Sacred Scripture compares it to that of <hi>Job:</hi> And that which is moſt conſiderable is, that it attributed the Cauſe thereof to the Piety and Fear of God wherein he had liv'd in his Youth. Behold what it ſays;<note n="a" place="margin">Hanc autem tentationem ideo permiſit Deus evenire illi, ut poſteris daretur exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae ejus ſicut &amp; ſancti Job: Nam cum ab inſantia ſua ſemper Deum timuerit, &amp; mandata ejus cuſtodierit, non eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſtatus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Deum, quod plaga caecitatis eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerit ei; ſed immobilis in Dei timore permanſit, agens gratias Deo omnibus diebus vitae ſuae.</note> 
                     <hi>Now God permitted that this Temptation ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him, to give to Poſterity an Example of his Patience, as of that of holy</hi> Job: <hi>For whereas he always feared God from his Youth, and kept his Commandments, he complain'd not againſt God for the Affliction of Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he ſent him, but continu'd immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Fear of God, giving him Thanks all the Days of his Life.</hi> O how admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the Effect of a Vertue which hath always increas'd with Age!<note n="b" place="margin">Sexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genarius lumen recepit; reliquum vero vitae in gaudio fuit; &amp; cum bono profactu timoris Dei porrexit in pace. <hi>Tob.</hi> 14.</note> He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33523:35"/>from that Affliction Four Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and liv'd to the Age of 110, when he dy'd in peace, after he had made, as the Scripture takes notice, a continual Progreſs in the Fear and Service of God. Thus, <hi>Theotime,</hi> do they Live, thus do they Die, who have ſpent their Life vertuouſly in their Youth.</p>

                  <p>A Difficulty ſo great, that it is almoſt impoſſible ſufficiently to expreſs it; and on the other ſide ſo general, that we cannot conſider it attentively, without being touch'd with a lively Sorrow, ſeeing ſo vaſt a number of Chriſtians, and principally of young People, who grone under the tyranny of a vicious Habit, which being contracted in their Youth, and increas'd with Age, leads them to Perdition; from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33523:36"/>whence if it chance they recover, it is with incredible Pains and Combats, and by a manifeſt Miracle of Divine Grace. Learn, O dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> to avoid this Danger, and endeavour to comprehend the greatneſs, either entirely to prevent it, or quickly to withdraw your ſelf, if you be already engag'd therein.</p>
                  <p>This ſo great a Difficulty ſprings from three Cauſes. The Firſt is the incredible Power and Force of a wicked Habit, which being once rooted in the Soul, cannot be pluckt up but with great trouble. All Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits have commonly this Quality, that they continue a long time, and are very hardly deſtroy'd. But amongſt others, wicked Habits are ſuch as adhere more ſtrongly, and are not ſo eaſily chang'd: Becauſe it is far more difficult to corrupt Nature to raiſe it ſelf to Good, than to do Evil. Hence it comes that the Scripture ſays,<note place="margin">Perverſi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>But amongſt wicked Habits, thoſe which are contracted in Youth are the ſtrongeſt, and with moſt difficulty overcome: For the Paſſions, which are the Inſtruments of Vice, not being moderated in that Time by Vertue, encreaſe with Age, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, augment and fortifie Vice, giving it daily new Forces, which render it at length unconquerable.</p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon the ſame Scripture ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Mind to expreſs the force of a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33523:37"/>vicious Habit, contracted in younger Years, delivers a Sentence which young People ought to have frequently before their Eyes.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Oſſa ejus implebuntur vitiis adoleſcentiae ejus, &amp; cum eo in pulvere dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mient; The Wicked ſhall be fill'd with Vices from his Youth, and they will follow him to his Grave:</hi> That is, the Vices and ill Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Youth become ſo deeply and ſtrongly rooted in the Soul, that all the remainder of his Life is ſenſible of them, and oppreſt with them, and they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue even until Death, as we daily ſee.</p>
                  <p>And the Cauſe thereof is very evident; for Vice which has once gotten poſſeſſion of a Soul, encreaſes and ſtrengthens the Paſſions; the Paſſions corrupt the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make it conceive that Good which is Evil, eſteem Evil that which is Good: The Judgment perverted corrupts the Will, which is carry'd blindly to Sin, and from thence proceeds all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Wickedneſs; becauſe, as S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays,<note n="a" place="margin">Ex volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te perverſa facta eſt libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, &amp; dum ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitur libidini, facta eſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudo, &amp; dum conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudini non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſtitur, facta eſt neceſſitas. <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Confeſ. cap.</hi> 3.</note>

                     <hi>Neceſſity is the Mother of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:33523:37"/>
                  <p>The Second Cauſe of this great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, is the Diminution of the Divine Grace: For as God augments his Favours to thoſe that humbly receive them, and make uſe of them for their Salvation; ſo he diminiſheth them to thoſe who abuſe and contemn them. Now if he treat Men in this manner, it ſeems that he more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily deals ſo with young Men; on whom as he beſtows many Favours when they worthily diſpoſe themſelves, as we have ſaid above, ſo he withdraws his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes from them when they abuſe them, as we have made appear by the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe, who having been favour'd with particular Obligations from God in their Youth, are preſently after ſenſible of a great diminution of thoſe Favours, occaſion'd by the ill uſe they have made of them.</p>
                  <p>God himſelf threatens this by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, when he ſpeaks thus;<note n="a" place="margin">In illa die deficient ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcentes in ſiti qui jurant in delicto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariae.</note> 
                     <hi>Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall periſh with Thirſt, who Swear in the Sin of Samaria:</hi> That is, who make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Adoring the Idols which the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> Adores. This Thirſt is not only a Corporeal, but a Spiritual Thirſt, and the want of Divine Grace, of which it is ſpoken immediately before.<note n="b" place="margin">Mittam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem panis neque ſitim aquae, ſed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diendi ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Dei.</note> 
                     <hi>I will ſend a Famine upon the Earth, not a Famine of Bread, nor a Drought of Water, but of the Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third Cauſe is the Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Devil, which is enlarg'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure that vicious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33523:38"/>are encreas'd, Sins multiply'd, and Divine Favours diminiſht. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Effect of Sin, which making a Soul loſe the Grace and Protection of her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to ſubject her to the Dominion of the Devil, and engage her more and more in that misfortunate Slavery, according to the proportion that ſhe continues in Vice. O <hi>Theotime!</hi> who can ſufficiently expreſs the deplorable State of a Soul reduc'd to that Servitude, under the Tyranny of her mortal Enemy, who employs all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines and Devices to deſtroy her without recovery; ſuggeſting all the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to her, which might move her unto Sin; furniſhing her daily with new Occaſions of Deſtruction, diverting her from thoſe that might withdraw her from Diſorder, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her headlong from Sin to Sin, from one Vice to another, until ſuch time that her Iniquities being come to a Head, ſhe by the utmoſt Effect of the Divine Choler, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd to her Eternal Perdition.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth this cruel Enemy treat thoſe whom he hath under his Power, and that by a juſt Permiſſion of God, who rejects in this manner thoſe who withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from his Service and Friendſhip, and who refuſing to ſubmit themſelves to his Commands, and to the plenty of his Favours and Benedictions, moſt juſtly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited to be abandon'd to that cruel Maſter, who breaths nothing but their Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will never<note n="*" place="margin">Servietis diis alienis die ac nocte qui non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt vobis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 66.</note> ceaſe to perſecute them, till he hath precipitated them into
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33523:38"/>Eternal Damnation. O <hi>Theotime,</hi> how misfortunate are all thoſe who are faln into this deplorable Slavery! but yet more miſerable thoſe, who being engag'd therein, think not of ſighing after their Deliverance.</p>

                  <p>Being Nineteen Years of Age, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd very effectual thoughts of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which God rais'd in him by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note n="*" place="margin">Ille vero Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mutavit affectum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp; ad te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum, Domine, mutavit preces meas ac vota, ac deſideria mea fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit alia.</note> a Book of <hi>Cicero,</hi> whoſe Title is <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> containing an Exhortation to Wiſdom.</p>

Who would not have believ'd, but that theſe good Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would have been ſoon follow'd by a perfect Converſion? But alas, <hi>Theotime,</hi> what is not a wicked Habit contracted in Youth able to do!

During which Time he not only remain'd in his former Diſorders, but fell into others yet greater: For as Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty leads to Error and Blindneſs, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſed into the Hereſie of <hi>Manichaeus;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he continu'd Nine Years, joyning to his Hereſie the continual keeping of a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine; in which State he liv'd from his firſt Corruption, until the Time of his Converſion.</p>
                  <p>Being about Thirty Years of Age, he thinks more ſeriouſly of his Converſion than formerly, as he deſcribes it in the Sixth Book Chap. 11. But hearken, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> with what trouble he purchas'd his Deſign.</p>

                  <p>AS in a Shipwreck, where a Ship is broken by a Tempeſt, there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways many who periſh, and very few who ſave themſelves by Swimming or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Thus in the Shipwreck of Vertue, which many fall into in their Youth, the number of thoſe who are entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd therein is very great, and of thoſe who eſcape very ſmall.</p>
                  <p>You will underſtand the ſmalneſs of this Number, when you ſhall know, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> that in all the Holy Hiſtory, a thing almoſt incredible, there is found but one only Example, in the Perſon of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> King of <hi>Juda,</hi> the Account whereof I ſhall give you hereafter; and that for this one it produces a vaſt number of others, who were miſerably Shipwreckt in the Storm, and are dead in the Vices of their Youth; ſome having liv'd a long time after, others being ſnatcht away by Death in the prime of their Age. I ſhall here recount you ſome Examples.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who to the number of Nineteen Reign'd over the Ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after the Diviſion that was made of that Kingdom from that of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Solomon,</hi> there was not one but was
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33523:43"/>extremely wicked from his Youth, nor any that was Converted before his Death.</p>
                  <p>And altho' the Scripture doth not make expreſs mention at all of the Life of their Youth, nevertheleſs it gives us ſufficiently to underſtand that they were wicked in that Age, ſaying of each of them abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were vicious, and not report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them one Action of Vertue, except of one, <hi>viz. Jehu,</hi> of whom it recounts ſome good Works which he perform'd at his beginning, altho' afterwards he was perverted like the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the Kings of <hi>Juda,</hi> who Reign'd to the number of Nineteen after <hi>Solomon,</hi> there were Six who were good; that is, <hi>Aſa, Joſaphat, Oſias, Joathan, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias, Joſias,</hi> and all the others were wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thoſe who were good, began from their Youth, and continu'd ſuch all their Life; the greateſt part of thoſe who were vicious, began their Wickedneſs in their younger Years, and were never chang'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is ſaid of King <hi>Ochoſias,</hi> That he began to Reign about Twenty two Years of Age, and was wicked, an Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of the Idolatry of impious <hi>Achab</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who was taught by his Mother <hi>Athalia,</hi> Siſter of that wicked King; And he Reign'd but a Year, at the end whereof he dy'd in his Wickedneſs.</p>

And he flying with his Children, was taken, and brought before the proud King; who after having receiv'd him with Expreſſions of Fury and Indignation, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Childrens Throats to be cut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Face, and afterwards pull'd out his Eyes, and made him be ſent Captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> where he dy'd miſerably, undergoing the juſt Puniſhment of his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Examples are very common in Sacred Scripture, the contrary are there very rare; and as I have ſaid, we ſhall find but one only in the Old Teſtament, who was truly Converted after he had liv'd wickedly in his Youth, <hi>viz.

His Iniquities went on encreaſing until the Fifteenth, or according to others, till the Two and twentieth Year of his Reign, wherein God ſent him an extreme Affliction. He was taken by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in the City of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſent Captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> loaden with Irons and Chains, caſt into a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Priſon, where he was daily afflicted with a vaſt number of Miſeries and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.</p>
                  <p>Being reduc'd to this extremity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, he began to open his Eyes, and call upon him in his Afflictions, whom he had forgotten in his Proſperity. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd his Iniquities, and begg'd Pardon for them with a truly contrite Heart, and by the force of Tears and Prayers obtain'd from God his Deliverance: After which he did Penance for his Sins, and liv'd in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs all the remainder of his Life, even to the Age of Sixty ſeven, when he dy'd.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Jerom</hi> adds to this Hiſtory a very remarkable Particularity, which he took out of the Tradition of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> For Explicating what the Scripture ſays in general Terms,<note n="*" place="margin">Qui poſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam coangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatus eſt, ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit Dominum Deum ſuum. <hi>Hieron. in queſ.

                     <p>This Evil is too viſible, and there needs no other Proof than daily Experience. How many young Souls do we ſee, who give fair Hopes by the excellent Qualities wherewith they are endow'd, who might make themſelves capable of ſome great Action, and one day ſucceed in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33523:49"/>Employment, where God might be Honour'd, and the Publick conſiderably Serv'd, who go and deſtroy themſelves at the Entrance, and coming to be miſled in Youth, make themſelves unfit for Noble Enterpriſes, for which they ſeem'd to be born, and frequently become idle Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and abſolutely unuſeful; like to ſome Trees, all cover'd with Bloſſoms in the Spring, which a nipping Froſt blaſts and makes unfruitful all the reſt of the Year.</p>
                     <p>This happens not only to thoſe to whom the Sins of Youth either haſten Death, or bring an Obdurateneſs in Vice, as we have ſaid, but alſo very frequently to thoſe who are withdrawn from Sin after the firſt Diſorders of their Youth, who having loſt by Idleneſs, which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily accompanies Sin in that Age, the moſt precious Time of all their Life, are made uncapable of any thing, and unuſeful for what is good. Or if they have not abſolutely loſt that Time, they are become by their reiterated and multiply'd Sins, unworthy of the Employments they were capable of, and to which God had deſign'd them.</p>
                     <p>Comprehend this well, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and that you may comprehend it better, take notice of what follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That God by his Providence deſigns young People to different Conditions, wherein he would Employ them for his Service and their Salvation; but upon this Condition, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33523:50"/>they render themſelves fit by their Labour during their Youth, and alſo make not themſelves undeſerving by their Sins. From whence it falls out, that when they addict themſelves to Vice, and forget God in their Youth, God in puniſhment of their Sins excludes them from thoſe Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to which they were call'd, and he had appointed for them in his firſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>This Truth is grounded upon Sacred Scripture; when God promis'd to <hi>David</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for himſelf and his Poſterity, it was upon this Condition,<note n="*" place="margin">Si cuſtodie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint filii tui teſtamentum meum, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.

                     <p>A little while before he had taken away the Honour of Prieſthood from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the High Prieſt <hi>Heli,</hi> becauſe he and his Children were become unworthy by their Sins.

                     <p>This Procedure appears moſt evident in the Caſe of <hi>Saul</hi> firſt King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:33523:50"/>God had given that Kingdom to him, and to his Family, but upon Condition, that they ſhould particularly obſerve his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.

                     <p>The Firſt was, when being one Day in his Camp, preſs'd by his Enemies to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a Battel, he Offer'd Sacrifice, not expecting the arrival of the Prophet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> who had forbidden him Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any thing before his Return.

                     <p>This Evil will ſeem to you at preſent incredible, but you will underſtand it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when you have made the leaſt reflection upon it.</p>
                     <p>For Firſt, If it be true, as we have ſhewn, that the Vices of Youth are very hardly Corrected, it follows, that a great part of the Corruption we ſee amongſt Men, ſprings from that which they had contracted in their younger Years.</p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:33523:51"/>
                     <p>Beſides, it is certain that bad Children become wicked Pathers, and wicked Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make their Children vicious: As they have liv'd in Diſorder during their Youth, they concern themſelves but little that their Children ſhould be Educated in the Fear of God; and thus Corruption is communicated, and paſſes from Father to Son by a continual Succeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Now if this Propoſition be verifi'd in the greateſt part of young Perſons, it is ſound more evident in thoſe who are call'd to Study; of whom it is true to ſay, that their wicked Life cauſes the greateſt part of the Sins and Diſorders of the World; becauſe they are the Men that attain to Dignities, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; wherein they behave themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inclinations and Habits they had learn'd in their Youth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt Impreſſions they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. Now when they comport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ill in theſe Conditions, the Evil ſtays not at their Perſons, but deſcends to many, <hi>viz.</hi> to thoſe they ought to Govern, Inſtruct or Edifie; who inſtead of receiving from them the Examples of Vertue, gather nothing but the Imitation of their Vices, and the Corruption of their Manners.</p>
                     <p>In a word, I ſay, <hi>Theotime,</hi> that vicious Students become Firſt in the Church wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prieſts, Ignorant, Unprofitable to God and his Church, and frequently Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, Idle, Covetous, Worldly and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33523:52"/>Incumbents; Paſtors incapable of their Charge, who acquit themſelves very badly of it, to the great Detriment of the Salvation of Souls. In the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen Proud, Quarrelſom, Duellers, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt, Blaſphemous, Libertines. In the the Courts of Juſtice, baſe Judges, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, Acceptors of Perſons, and who commit many Injuſtices for Mony, Favour, or Fear, thro' the Ignorance or Raſhneſs with which they give Sentence; Advocates that are Wranglers, Impoſtors and Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In the Civil State, Magiſtrates inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of their Charges, little careful of their Duty, who ſee Vice and hinder it not. And from the Corruption of theſe Four ſorts of Perſons ſprings the Depravation of the People, and the overflowing of Vice in the World.</p>
                     <p>Conſider attentively, O dear <hi>Theotome,</hi> all theſe four Evils one after another, and learn by their greatneſs how important a thing it is for you to addict your ſelf to Vertue in your Youth.</p>

                     <hi>Theotime,</hi> that I may make you comprehend, how important a thing it is for you to addict your ſelf to God in your Youth; there remains that I
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33523:52"/>ſhould tell you, That the Devil, that ſworn Enemy of Mens Salvation, fearing nothing more than to ſee you Vertuous in your Youth, employs all his Endeavors to gain you to him, and all thoſe of your Age, that he may deſtroy you preſently after without recovery.</p>
                  <p>This Truth is a very manifeſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from all that we have ſaid before.<note place="margin">The Attempt of the Devil to deſtroy young People.</note> That curſed Fiend, who ſtudies nothing but to rob God, as much as he can, of the Honor due to him, and Men of the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prepar'd for them, knows very well, that to incline Youth to Vice, is the means to take away from God the firſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Acknowledgment which Men owe him. He knows in the Second place, how much a wicked Life of Youth is injurious to God, as we have manifeſted above: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he underſtands very well, that there is no other more certain way to fill the Earth with Iniquities, and to Damn all Mankind. This is the reaſon why he employs all his Induſtry to deprave the Innocence of Youth, as the firſt Source of Salvation, and of all the Bleſſings of the World. He knows well, that to empoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Waters of a Fountain, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to caſt Venom into the Spring, which communicates it eaſily to all the Brooks: And that to Conquer a Realm, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to gain the chief Places which give Entrance into all the reſt of the Country.</p>
                  <p>This misfortunate Fiend underſtands well how to put in practice the Malice he

                  <p>THE Firſt Means to acquire Vertue,<note place="margin">Firſt Means, the knowledge of true Vertue.</note> is the knowledge of real Vertue, and the diſcerning of ſolid Piety from that which is falſe and imaginary.</p>
                  <p>Many ſeem to love Vertue,<note place="margin">Many ſorts of falſe Vertue.</note> who are far from it, becauſe they love not Vertue as it is in its ſelf, but as they repreſent it to themſelves in their Mind, every one form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to his own Idea, and according to his own Inclination: For ſome think themſelves Vertuous, when they are not of the number of the Wicked. Others place Vertue in abſtaining from certain
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33523:58"/>Vices, for which they have a kind of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, altho' they are ſubject to others which are no leſs criminal in the ſight of God. Others eſteem themſelves when they are addicted to ſome Actions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Piety, altho' on the other ſide they wholly neglect the interior regulation of their Conſcience, which is ordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd with mortal Sins. And all theſe are ſo much more to be lamented, as they imagine themſelves to be in a good Way, when they are abſolutely out of it; and thinking to arrive by that Courſe at the Port of Salvation, they find themſelves at length Travelling in the direct Way to Perdition, verifying in that reſpect, that Saying of Solomon, <hi>Eſt via quae videtur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini recta, &amp; noviſſima ejus ducunt ad mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; There is a Way which to a Man ſeems ſtraight, and the end of it leads to Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vertue, <hi>Theotime,</hi> doth not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eſteem of Men, it is the Work of God; from him then muſt we learn its Rule, there being none but he who can preſcribe it as it is to be follow'd.</p>
                  <p>Hearken then to what he himſelf ſpeaks of it in the Sacred Scripture,<note place="margin">True Vertue conſiſts in the Fear of God.</note> and he will teach you how Wiſdom, that is, Vertue, <hi>conſiſts in fearing God, and flying abſolutely from Sin,</hi>

                     <hi>Fear God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and obſerve his Commandments, for in that is all Man;</hi> in that conſiſts the Perfection of Man, for that he was born, that is his laſt End and abſolute Felicity.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the Sacred Scripture acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges no other Wiſdom or Piety than the Fear of God, which it calls<note n="b" place="margin">Initium Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiae Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor Domini. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Fear is not that which is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſervil, which apprehends more the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment than the Deteſtation of Sin; but it is an amorous Fear of the Children of God, which makes them hate Sin becauſe it diſpleaſeth God, and love Good, becauſe it is agreeable to him. Like the Fear and Reſpect a young Godly Child bears his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which makes him fearful to offend him, and ſeek diligently all Means to pleaſe him generally in his Actions.</p>
                  <p>So that, <hi>Theotime,</hi> according to the Maxims of the Divine School, true Vertue conſiſts in the Fear of God, which punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and for the love of him produces the obſervation of the Commandments, and which cauſes a fear and deteſtation of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God above all things, and ſeeks the Means to pleaſe him. This alone ought to be accounted Vertue, and that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33523:59"/>which is not directed by this certain and infallible Rule, is to be eſteem'd falſe Piety.</p>

If this be certain in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things we undertake, it is yet more infallible in Vertue; becauſe the love and deſire of Vertue is one part of Vertue it ſelf, and a very powerful Means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it.</p>
                  <p>It is the Means the Wiſeman gives you, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> and which he himſelf made uſe of with very good ſucceſs. In the Sixth Chapter of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> he ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Clara eſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia &amp; quae nunquam marceſcit, &amp; facile videtur ab his qui di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligunt Eam, &amp; invenitur ab his qui quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt Illam: praeoccupat eos qui ſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcunt ut illis ſe prior oſtendat. <hi>Sap.</hi> 6.</note> That <hi>Wiſdom is a thing which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hidden, nor be ſubject to Corruption,</hi> nor to be eaſily loſt out of the ſight of him that ſeeks her; for, <hi>She is quickly perceiv'd by thoſe who love her, ſhe prevents thoſe who deſire her, and goes before to manifeſt her ſelf to them.</hi> But hearken how he himſelf made uſe of theſe Means in his Youth, and learn to conform your ſelf to that Divine Original.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith in the Seventh Chapter, That
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33523:59"/>having conſider'd the common Miſery of Men, who are all born in Weakneſs and Ignorance, he began to ſigh after, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire this Wiſdom, and to be freed from theſe Afflictions.<note n="*" place="margin">Propter hoc optavi &amp; da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt mihi ſenſus.

                  </p>
                  <p>Having afterwards deſcrib'd the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Wonders of Wiſdom, he adds in the Eighth Chapter,<note n="*" place="margin">Hanc amavi &amp; exquiſivi eam à juven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute mea, &amp; quaeſivi Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam mihi eam aſſumere, &amp; amator ſum factus formae ipſius: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſui ergo hanc adducere mihi ad convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendum, ſciens quoniam mecum communicabit de bonis, &amp; erit allocutio cogitationis &amp; taedii mihi. <hi>Sap.</hi> 8.</note>

For this reaſon hath he eſtabliſh'd in his Church Paſtors and Doctors, as the Apoſtle ſaith, to teach Men Divine Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and conduct them in the Way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>Now if Inſtruction be neceſſary for all Men, it is yet moſt of all for young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who by reaſon of their Age have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knowledge of the Maxims of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and leſs Capacity to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is not then ſufficient for you dear, <hi>Theotime,</hi> that you daily beg Wiſdom and Vertue from Almighty God, you muſt love and ſeek after Inſtruction and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Way, by them who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
                  <p>This Deſire of Inſtruction is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Vertue, that it is the beginning thereof, according to that ſaying of the Wiſeman, <hi>The beginning,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is a real Deſire of Inſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Converſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>conſtantly with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, whom you know to have the fear of God, whoſe Mind hath a ſympathy with yours,</hi> that is, who mutually love one another, <hi>and who will compaſſionate your Misfortune, if you chance to trip in the dark;</hi> giving you aſſiſtance that you fall not, or raiſing you

                     <hi>My Advice,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is, that you Converſe with Men of Piety. Be not your own Maſter, nor enter a Way unknown to you without a Guide, leſt you ſhould miſtake your Rode, and periſh in your wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring; or going faſter or ſlower than need requires, you be tir'd with your haſte, and ſo return, or fall aſteep in your Journey.</hi> This is then, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> a very important Admonition, which after St. <hi>Jerome</hi> and the Fathers, I give you here.</p>
                  <p>Make choice of a diſcreet and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Confeſſor, to whom commit the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of your Conſcience: Let him be a Perſon who is able to Direct you in the Path of Vertue, who is able to Teach you the true Maxims of Piety; Diſcover to you the things you ought to perform, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33523:64"/>thoſe you muſt avoid; Reduce you into the Way when you are gone out of the Road; Raiſe you when you ſhall fall; Advertiſe you of the Dangers you are likely to run into; Teach you how to reſiſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and cure your ill Habits; Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you in Vertue; Awake you when you are ſleepy in the Way, and withhold you from running too faſt, leſt you ſhould fall from your firſt Zeal and Fervour into Remiſsneſs, and from Remiſsneſs into Vice, which eaſily happens to young People. Theſe are the Benefits you will receive from your Director, and you will have need of him for all theſe things.</p>
                  <p>For this Effect declare unto him from time to time your Conſcience,<note place="margin">Practice.</note> let him know clearly your State, conceal nothing of your interior Inclination, have a great Reſpect for him, as for a Man by whom God Speaks to you and Directs you; Put a confidence in his Conduct and Counſels, hearken attentively to his Admonitions, be exact in putting in practice his Advices, give him an Account of the Uſe you have made of them;<note place="margin">A remarkable Advice.</note> Be not aſham'd to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto him all your Sins; and chiefly have a care of falling into the fault of many, who having committed a greater Sin than uſually, go to Confeſs themſelves to another, out of a fooliſh Shame they have to declare their Sins to their ordinary Confeſſor. To do this, is to render the Conduct of a Ghoſtly Father entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and to take the way to fall into
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33523:64"/>many Sins, and at the end to be utterly loſt. No, no, <hi>Theotime,</hi> you muſt bear towards your Confeſſor the Confidence of a Child towards his Father, of a ſick Perſon towards his Phyſician, to diſcover all that is within you equally both good and bad.</p>
                  <p>But to find this ſo neceſſary a Director, you muſt demand him of God: Beg of him from the bottom of your Heart, that he make you meet with a good one, and without queſtion he will comply with your Requeſt. Ask alſo the Counſel of ſome prudent and vertuous Perſon, and when you have found him, change him not eaſily without neceſſity; and if he chance to fail you either by Death or change of Dwelling, or otherwiſe, make choice readily of another.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>h eotime,</hi> how happy would you be, if you liv'd in this manner; you would walk with aſſurance in the Path of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would advance very much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; whereas going without a Guide, you will always be in danger of ſtragling out of the Way and being loſt.</p>
                  <p>Call to mind one remarkable thing,<note place="margin">4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 12. 2 <hi>Paral.</hi> 24.</note> which the Scripture recounts of King <hi>Joas.</hi> That King had been Educated by the High Prieſt <hi>Joiada</hi> in the Fear of God,<note place="margin">A conſiderable Example.</note> Inſtructed in his Law, and Directed in the Way of Vertue from the Age of Seven Years till after Forty; During all this time he liv'd holily, and the Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the Cauſe to the Conduct of that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33523:65"/>pious Man.<note place="margin">4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 12. Fecitque Joas rectum coram Domino cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis diebus quibus docuit eum Joiada Sacerdos.</note> 
                     <hi>Joas,</hi> ſays the Scripture, <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd himſelf vertuouſly all the time that he was Inſtructed by Joiada the High Prieſt.</hi> But he did not continue always in that State: For <hi>Joiada</hi> being Deceas'd, that misfortunate Prince being no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by the good Corrections and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Counſels of his Religious Maſter, gave himſelf over to Licentiouſneſs, and to the Diſorders of a wicked Life; by which he drew upon himſelf many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, and a miſerable Death, which God ſent him preſently after. This Example will teach you what value you ought to ſet on a good Maſter in the Way of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of Confeſſion, and firſt of a General Confeſſion.</head>
                  <p>PEnance being a Sacrament Inſtituted by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to blot out the Sins of Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Sixth Means, a General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> and to reſtore them to the Grace of God. There is no queſtion but it is a very proſitable Means, and neceſſary to acquire Vertue and Sanctity, which ought to begin by the cleanſing ones ſelf from Vice.</p>
                  <p>Now to the end this Means may prove more profitable to you, I adviſe you to begin with a General Confeſſion of all your Life; And this for Three Reaſons.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:33523:65"/>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe it frequently happens, that the precedent Confeſſions were inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid: As when one has conceal'd therein any mortal Sin, which falls out but too often to young People; or when one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes himſelf with too little Preparation, without Sorrow for his Sins, and without Reſolution of Amendment. In theſe Caſes a General Confeſſion is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe altho' one ſee not an evident Invalidity in the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, yet nevertheleſs there is reaſon to have ſome doubt, becauſe of many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects with which they ordinarily abound, thro' the Negligence of Penitents, who Confeſs themſelves with very little Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, almoſt without any Sorrow, and without any Amendment. The General Confeſſion ſupplies theſe Defects, and when it is well perform'd, ſecures the Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If it be not at all neceſſary, it will be always very profitable; for Three great Benefits you will receive thereby: The one is in reſpect of your Self, the other on your Confeſſor's ſide, and the Third in regard of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In reſpect of your Self, bringing your paſt Life before your Eyes, it makes you know how far you are remov'd from the Way of your Salvation; humble your ſelf before God in the acknowledgment of your Miſery, take notice of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd Inclinations to correct them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a deſire of Amendment, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33523:66"/>your ſelf entirely to Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, On your Confeſſor's ſide; It ſerves to give him a perfect knowledge of your Conſcience, that he may better Direct you, and give you Advice according to your Neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And in fine, in regard of God, it will avail to merit from him more abundant Favours for your perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, which he will communicate to you by ſo much more<note n="*" place="margin">Cor contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiciet Deus. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.</note> as he ſhall ſee you humbled before him, and penitent for your Offences.</p>
                  <p>To perform well this Confeſſion, ſee what you are to obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The End of a General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> Let the Mark or But at which you aim, be the amendment of your Life, and withdrawing your ſelf from Sin, to put your ſelf abſolutely in the Way of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Preparation.</note> Prepare your ſelf Seven or Eight Days before; and during that time, employ your ſelf in Two things. 1. Call to mind your Sins. 2. Conceive a great Sorrow, and a firm Reſolution to change your Life.</p>
                  <p>To accompliſh the firſt, employ ſome time every Day to Examine your ſelf, following the Order of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God and of the Church, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Seven Capital Sins. For the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er facility make uſe of ſome Book of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and write down every Day what you ſhall take notice of.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:33523:66"/>
                  <p>But let your Labor be chiefly about the Second Part, <hi>viz.</hi> Contrition;<note place="margin">Contrition.</note> which is the moſt neceſſary and moſt difficult;<note place="margin">Second Means to obtain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</note> and that for which one is ordinarily leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd. Here we muſt employ, 1. Prayer to obtain it of God. 2. The Reading of things which may cauſe a horror for Sin, and a deſire to Serve God; But this muſt be a fervent Prayer, and a ſerious and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Reading.</p>
                  <p>Withdraw your ſelf once or twice a day into a private Place, and there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate your ſelf before God, beſeeching him humbly and ardently, that he would beſtow upon you a Heart and Grace to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend perfectly the grievouſneſs of Sin, and the Injury it offers to his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to have a true Contrition for them, and abſolutely depart from them by a ſerious Repentance, and a perfect Change of your Life.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards apply your ſelf to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Book which may diſcover to you the horror of Sin, and the importance of retiring your ſelf from it. You will find many; I adviſe you chiefly to make uſe of <hi>Granado's Memorial</hi> in the Firſt Part, where he hath an excellent Preparation for a General Confeſſion: Read that, or ſome other which you have, with much Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taking every time one or two Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters only, which you ſhall read often, and meditate attentively upon them, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſtir up by the things you read, a hatred for Sin, a horror for having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33523:67"/>it, deploring your Miſery, and demanding of God Pardon for your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and Grace to free your ſelf from them.</p>
                  <p>The Day of your Confeſſion being come, after having beg'd of God the Grace to perform well this Action of ſo great importance, approach to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a profound Reſpect, with a great Recollection of Mind, and with much Sorrow of Heart for having offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God. Accuſe your ſelf of your Sins humbly and plainly: After your Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proteſt to your Confeſſor, that you deteſt them with all your Heart, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by reaſon of the infinite Goodneſs of God, whom you have heinouſly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that you humbly beg Pardon, and are reſolv'd to die rather than offend him any more; entreating him that he will In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you in the neceſſary Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin, that you may fall no more, and the Means from thenceforward to live in Vertue and the Fear of God. This being done, hearken attentively to what he ſhall ſay, not thinking of any thing elſe. And when you ſhall be upon the point of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Abſolution, recollect your Spirit within you, and humbling your ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly before God, renew all the Sorrow you might have had for your Sins, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Mercy, that he would Abſolve you in Heaven at the ſame time that the Prieſt Abſolves you on his part upon Earth.</p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:33523:67"/>
                  <p>O bleſſed Day, <hi>Theotime,</hi> wherein you are freed from the State of Sin, and Power of the Devil, to be admitted into the number of the Children of God, and for ever to Serve him faithfully.</p>
                  <p>But have a care to make this Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion profitable, and not to forget it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, as it happens to many, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſcarce ever think of it, and ſo return to their former Life. Have a care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new daily in the Morning the Sorrow for having offended God, and the Reſolution you have made not to Diſpleaſe him any more upon any account whatſoever.</p>

                  <p>THAT Confeſſion is not only a very profitable Means, but abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep Man in the Path of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is a Truth made manifeſt by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which diſcovers, That thoſe who practice not frequently this Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, relapſe ſoon into their firſt Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and into the Sins they had forſaken. So that, <hi>Theotime,</hi> you muſt hold it for an undoubted Maxim, That if you have a true Deſign to live in Vertue, you muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently approach to the Sacrament of Penance; and if not, you will never be difengag'd from Vice, not from the Way of Perdition; which I ſhall clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by the following Reaſons.</p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:33523:68"/>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt Reaſon.</note> Becauſe altho' you may be ſome time without falling into mortal Sin, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs without frequent Confeſſion you cannot avoid a great number of other Sins, which being multiply'd and neglected, lead to mortal Sin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Second Reaſon.</note> Without frequent Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you may be ſecretly engag'd in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Habits, which you will not believe to be ſuch, and will be expos'd to many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Occaſions, from which you cannot guard your ſelf, unleſs you be Admoniſh'd. Now you cannot be Advertis'd, but by often diſcovering your Conſcience to a diſcreet Confeſſor, who will take notice of them, and give you warning to avoid them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Third Reaſon.</note> It is impoſſible that you ſhould continue a long time without being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by Temptations, and principally againſt Chaſtity: Now I maintain, that it is impoſſible you ſhould reſiſt them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frequent Confeſſion. Do what you will, if you make not often uſe of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, you will infallibly be ſubdu'd, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will make you ſee it. He that neglects Help, will fall into Sickneſs, and from Sickneſs come to Death.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourth Reaſon.</note> Confeſſion, <hi>Theotime,</hi> is a Help and Remedy againſt Sin. 1. Becauſe it being a Sacrament, it gives Grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it. 2. Becauſe it makes us renew the Deteſtation of Sin, and the Reſolution not to commit it any more. 3. Becauſe the Admonitions of the Ghoſtly Father in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33523:68"/>awake the Penitent, and encourage him anew to fly from Sin, and to be faithful to God. 4. Becauſe the Penitent declaring his Temptations to his Confeſſor, learns from him the Means to reſiſt them; yea, this only diſcovering the Temptations, is an effectual Remedy to overcome them. The malignant Spirit fears nothing ſo much as to be diſcover'd; He is a Serpent which hides himſelf when he would bite, and flies away when he is perceiv'd; He is a right Thief, who hath no mind to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in open day; and he hath no greater Policy to deſtroy young Souls, than to make them be ſilent in the Affairs of their Conſcience, and to hinder them from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting to any one the State of their Soul, to the end, that in this pernicious Silence they may find no Help to reſiſt their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, nor Means to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Vices.<note n="*" place="margin">Peccatum proditum citò curatur, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vero ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur; vitium ſi patet fit ex magno puſillum, ſi latet, fit ex minimo magnum. <hi>S. Bern. Serm. de interiori domo, cap.</hi> 37.</note> 
                     <hi>Sin</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>) <hi>is ſoon cur'd when it is declar'd; but it encreaſes by ſilence; If one diſcover it, from great it becomes little; and if one conceal it, of little it becomes great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After theſe Reaſons I doubt not, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> but that you are fully convinc'd of the neceſſity of Confeſſing often; and being this is an Affair of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and a Man commits many Faults therein, I have many Advices to give
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33523:69"/>you, which I beſeech you read attentively, and take notice of them well.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Important Advices concerning Confeſſion.</head>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">First Advice.</note> Confeſs your ſelf at leaſt once a Month, without failing therein. If you have frequent Temptations, you ought to Confeſs oftner, and principally at the time wherein you perceive the Temptations begin to aſſault you moſt ſtrongly. Fake notice well of this Advice, for it is of great importance, and for want of practiſing it, many relapſe miſerably into Sin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Second Advice.</note> Have a care of falling into that Offence of many, who never think of Confeſſing themſelves, but when they have yielded to a Temptation. It is a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Abuſe by which the Devil misfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſeduces many Souls: For what a great folly is it, not to apply ones thoughts to a Remedy, till after he is fall'n into a mortal Diſtemper, when it might have been prevented by Help in time? accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Counſel of the Wiſeman,<note place="margin">Eccl. <hi>15.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Ante languorem adhibe medicinam; Apply the Remedy to prevent the Diſtemper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Third Advice.</note> Have a care alſo of another greater Fault of thoſe, who having been ſubdu'd by a Temptation, inſtead of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſing themſelves, and having recourſe to the Sacrament of Penance, permit themſelves to yield to all Occaſions, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to Confeſs themſelves, whether for fear, remiſsneſs, or negligence of their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33523:69"/>Salvation, until the Occurrence of ſome great Feaſt obliges them thereunto. This Abuſe is common amongſt young Perſons, and the Cauſe that many fall back after good Reſolutions, and often relapſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after into Vice. We muſt not loſe Courage for having fall'n, but raiſe our ſelves preſently, and make uſe of that Slip for our Advantage, and ſtand better on our Guard for the future.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourth Advice.</note> Confeſs your ſelf uſually to your ordinary Confeſſor as often as you can; ſo that nevertheleſs if you find him not, you go to another, and let not his Abſence be the Cauſe of your failing to Confeſs your ſelf, when there is a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Fiſth Advice.</note> Be aſſur'd that the Devil will uſe all his Endeavors to hinder you from Confeſſing often; he will oppoſe all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles imaginable: Sometimes he will make you believe it is too much trouble, ſometimes that you are not ſufficiently prepar'd, ſometimes that you have no need; at another time he makes ſome Buſineſs fall out; oftentimes he will raiſe up ſome Diſguſt againſt Confeſſion; ſometimes, and very frequently, he will endeavor to withdraw you from it by a certain fooliſh Shame, which he is accuſtom'd to ſtir up in thoſe of your Age, by which he makes them bluſh to perform Acts of Piety. A thouſand other Impediments will he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to hinder you from ſo proſitable and neceſſary a Means of your Salvation. But
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33523:70"/>in the Name of God, <hi>Theotime,</hi> paſs by all theſe Hindrances, and look upon all thoſe Thoughts, which aim at withdrawing you from Confeſſion, as Temptation of the Devil.</p>
                     <p>Now to Confeſs well, endeavor to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve diligently that which follows.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Means to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs well.</note> Examine your Conſcience the beſt you can concerning Sins to which you are moſt inclin'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. After Examination ſtir up in your ſelf a Sorrow for having offended God, and beg Pardon of him with all your Heart.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Approach to Confeſſion with much Reſpect and Modeſty, repreſenting to your ſelf that you are going to appear before God, as before your Judge, to implore his Mercy; And if you be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to expect, before you can be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, keep your ſelf in an humble and modeſt Poſture, Praying or Reading ſome good Book.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Declare your Sins humbly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, making your Confeſſor underſtand them clearly. There are ſome who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs but half their Sins, and expect that the Confeſſor ſhould ask the reſt; This is a great Abuſe, which frequently makes the Confeſſions null, and Sacrilegious.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Have a great care never to conceal a mortal Sin in Confeſſion thro' Shame or otherwiſe. That is a very heinous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which often happens to young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and particularly for certain Sins of Impurity, which they dare not diſcover,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33523:70"/>by a misfortunate Baſhfulneſs, which makes them frequently commit great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crileges, and keeps them in a continual State of mortal Sin. O <hi>Theotime,</hi> never fall into that Diſaſter by which the Devil ſeduces, and miſerably deſtroys young Perſons.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Seek not by your Confeſſions to be eſteem'd by your Ghoſtly Father, but to be cur'd of your Sins, and directed by him in the Way of Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Having made your Confeſſion, give ear attentively to the Admonitions of your Ghoſtly Father, and to the Advice he ſhall give you, and imitate not many, who think of nothing but calling to mind their Sins, while the Confeſſor ſpeaks to them; Have a care of this Fault, for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and makes one loſe almoſt all the Fruit of Confeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Before your Ghoſtly Father gives you Abſolution, and alſo whilſt he ſhall pronounce it, beg Pardon of God for your Sins with much Sorrow and Regret for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed them, with a firm Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by the aſſiſtance of his Grace, to endeavor to Amend. You muſt deteſt mortal Sins as infinitely oppoſite to the Goodneſs of God, and your Salvation; and for others you muſt be ſorry, becauſe they are diſpleaſing to God, and always have a Reſolution to correct them in your ſelf as much as you can.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Perform your Penance punctually and devoutly.</p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:33523:71"/>
                     <p n="10">10. Accuſtom your ſelf on the Day of your Confeſſion, to make Reflection upon the principal Sins into which you have fall'n, that you may amend them: Call to mind alſo the Advices your Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall have given you, and purpoſe to put them in Practice.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of Holy Communion.</head>
                  <p>OUR Saviour and Redeemer <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had ſo great a deſire of our Sanctification and Eternal Happineſs, that he was not ſatisfi'd with the Inſtitution of the Sacrament of Penance, wherein he left Power to his Apoſtles to remit our Sins, but by Incomprehenſible Exceſs of his Love, he hath left us the moſt Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt, wherein he really gives himſelf for the Nouriſhment of our Souls, to conſerve them in the Life of Grace, to cure them of their Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to ſtrengthen them in their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and conduct them happily unto Life Eternal.</p>
                  <p>From whence it follows, That the Holy Communion is a neceſſary Means for thoſe who aſpire to Vertue, and that thoſe who have a true deſire of their Salvation, ought to make themſelves worthy to approach frequently unto it.<note n="*" place="margin">Niſi mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caveritis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem filii ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, &amp; bibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis ejus ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem, non habebitis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam in vobis. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.</note>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:33523:71"/>
                  <p>It is from this Living Fountain of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Graces, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> from whence you may abundantly draw all the Favours and Vertues that are neceſſary for you. You ſeek after Wiſdom, and here you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Eternal Wiſdom in his proper Perſon. You deſire Purity, and here you receive Purity it ſelf. You want Force to conſerve Vertue amidſt the Dangers and Impediments of this Life, and you receive here the Author of all Graces, who can defend you againſt every thing that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it ſelf to your Salvation.</p>
                  <p>This being ſo, you muſt approach to it frequently, and not refuſe the Grace of this Divine Saviour, who with ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Love gives himſelf to you. Now he evidently manifeſts that he hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his Salvation, who neglects ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and wholſom a Means, which contains nothing leſs than the Author of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Altho' a general Time for Communion cannot be preſcrib'd, becauſe it depends upon the particular State of every one, yet I ſhall tell you, that it is ſeaſonable to Communicate ordinarily once a Month. If you confeſs oftner than once a Month, as we have ſaid above, may be ſometimes expedient for you, you ſhall take the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of your Ghoſtly Father concerning Communion, who ſometimes will counſel it, when he ſees you profit thereby, and have an earneſt deſire to approach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Sometimes alſo he will think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to defer it till another time, to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33523:72"/>prepare your ſelf the better for an Action of ſuch high Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Now being that all the Fruit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion depends upon Communicating with requiſite Diſpoſitions, theſe are the Advices you ſhall obſerve to Communicate well; mark them carefully, and read them every time you come to Communion.</p>

                     <hi>non enim homini praeparatur habitatio, ſed Deo.</hi> It is a great Work wherein one prepares a Dwelling not for Man, but for God. It is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, Theotime,</hi> true God, and true Man, for whom you prepare an Habitation in your Soul, you muſt then prepare one worthy of him.</p>
                  <p>Be diligent to go to the Church to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your Prayers to God,<note place="margin">Second.</note> and Confeſs your ſelf; wherein you ſhall ask of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, whether he think it convenient you
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33523:72"/>ſhould Communicate, and if he judge it fit, you ſhall prepare your ſelf in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Take about half an Hour before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,<note place="margin">Third Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> wherein recollecting your thoughts within your ſelf, you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which follows. 1.

Is it therefore poſſible</hi> (ſaid <hi>Solomon,</hi> having built the Temple) <hi>that God ſhould dwell amongſt Men?</hi> 2. Beg of him Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for your Sins, which make you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to Receive him. 3. Implore his Grace to Receive him worthily, that is, with a pure Conſcience, with a lively Faith, with a profound Humility, with an ardent love of his Goodneſs, and with an inviolable Reſolution to Serve him all your Life. If you know any Prayers for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſay them, but with Attention and Feeling.</p>
                  <p>The time of Communion being come, leave all your vocal Prayers, approach mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly to the Altar, with your Eyes caſt down, not looking on one ſide or the other, nor preſſing to come firſt, but let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Crowd paſs, if there be any.

                  <p>Being retir'd from the Altar, ſay not preſently your Vocal Prayers upon your Book, but entertain your ſelf ſome time inwardly with your Saviour which you enjoy within you. 1.

                     <hi>that my God comes to viſit me?</hi> Acknowledge that you are undeſerving that Favour. 3.

                  <p>Return modeſtly from the Church, and make all the reſt of the Day reliſh of this

                  <p>COnfeſſion and Communion are very eſſicacious Means to acquire Vertue,<note place="margin">Ninth Means, Morning Prayer.</note> but they become unprofitable and of ſmall effect, unleſs they be accompany'd with theſe which follow: Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer, Aſſiſting devoutly at the Holy Sacrifice of the Altar, Employing ones Time in the knowledge of ones ſelf, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Books, and pious Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are Means ſo neceſſary for Vertue, that Reſpiration and Nouriſhment are not more needful for the ſupport of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Life, than theſe things are neceſſary for the Conſervation of Piety, which is the Life of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>I begin with Morning Prayer, which the Wiſeman, amongſt the Means he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to obtain Wiſdom, recommends ſo effectually unto you.<note n="*" place="margin">Cor ſuum tradet ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilandum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luculo, ad Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum qui fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit eum &amp; in conſpectu al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimi deprecabitur, aperiet os ſuum in oratione, &amp; pro delictis ſuis deprecabitur. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 39.6.</note>

                  <p>I would to God this excellent Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were deeply engraven in the Minds of Men, and principally of young Perſons, as one of the moſt important to live in Vertue.

                  <p>We own unto God all our Actions, but chiefly the firſt in the Morning; it is that which is moſt agreeable unto him, it is by that we conſecrate others unto him: By it we attract the Divine Bleſſings upon all our Works, and collect the Divine Grace for all the Day; As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Deſert gather'd in the Morning the Manna of Heaven which maintain'd them all the Day.</p>
                  <p>And that which is moſt remarkable in that Manna, is, that thoſe who fail'd to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it in the Morning, found it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, becauſe it was melted at the riſing of the Sun, whereof the Scripture gives this excellent Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That God who made it Rain every Morning, caus'd it to be diſſolv'd with the firſt Beams of the Sun;<note n="*" place="margin">Quod enim ab igne non poterat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminari, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim ab exiguo radio ſolis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactum ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcebat, ut notum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus eſſet, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam oportet praevenire ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ad tuam benedictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp; ad ortum ſolis to adorare. <hi>Sap.</hi> 18.</note>

                  <p>IF it be a Buſineſs of Importance to begin well the Day,<note place="margin">Tenth Means, Evening Prayer.</note> it is of no leſs to finiſh it perfectly. In the ancient Law God had not only commanded a Sacrifice for every Morning, but alſo for every Night, to teach us, that as we ought to Adore him in the beginning of the Day, ſo we owe him our Acknowledgment at the end of the Day.</p>
                  <p>The principal part of this Action is the Examen of Conſcience,<note place="margin">The Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Examen of Conſcience at Night.</note> which is a thing wherein you ought not to fail, if you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly deſire to advance in Vertue. 1.

It helps to diſcover the Faults one has committed to amend them, and preſerve ones ſelf from them, to continue a hatred of mortal Sin, and a Will not to commit it any more. 3. Without this Exerciſe we fall into many Offences, which being neglected lead us to mortal Sin; we are lull'd aſleep in Sin, without a deſire or thought of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves. 4. By this Exerciſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Confeſſions are made more eaſie and frequent, we amend our Lives, we prevent an unprovided Death, we prepare our ſelves for Death, Judgment, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; And it is in this Action that we

For this effect, paſs over in your Memory the principal Actions you have done from Morning till Night, and take notice of the Faults you may have committed therein. Recollect your ſelf, whether you have had any Temptations that Day; Examine how you have behav'd your ſelf in them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have readily reſiſted them, or with negligence. Take notice of what Company you have been in, and whether at the ſame time you have acted any thing indecently, either by giving ill Example in Word or Deed; or not hindring others wicked Actions, when you might divert

                  <p>THE moſt holy and adorable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Altar,<note place="margin">Eleventh Means.</note> is the greateſt of all our Myſteries, and the moſt excellent Action of our Religion: It is a Sacrifice which our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, wherein by the real Oblation of his Body and Blood. 1. We give God the greateſt Honor he can receive. 2. We worthily return him Thanks for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. 3. We render him propitious to pardon our Offences. 4. We obtain his Graces and Favors; And that which the ancient Law did by four ſorts of Sacrifices, we perform, and that more perfectly, by this alone, which is altogether <hi>Latreutick,</hi> that is, Honouring God; <hi>Euchariſtick,</hi> that is, Thankſgiving; <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring God Favourable; and <hi>Impetratory,</hi> Obtaining Graces from him.</p>
                  <p>They who are preſent at this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, partake of theſe four ſorts of Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and receive great Advantages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſuppoſing they Hear it as they ought.</p>
                  <p>To Aſſiſt at it therefore as we ought, Three things are neceſſary, <hi>Attention, Reſpect,</hi> and <hi>Devotion. Attention,</hi> To have the Mind preſent, and attentive to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Action. <hi>Reſpect,</hi> To be preſent with a great Modeſty as to the Exterior, and a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33523:77"/>profound Reverence of the Soul at this adorable Sacrifice, at which the Angels themſelves Aſſiſt with fear and trembling. <hi>Devotion,</hi> Not to Hear it negligently and by cuſtom, as many times we do, but on Deſign to partake of the four Effects of this Sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi> To give him Thanks for his Favors; To implore his Mercy for our Sins; To demand Favors, and chiefly that of Converting our Selves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to him; And to live for ever in his Service.</p>
                  <p>Endeavour then, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to be preſent daily as much as you can, at this ſublime Sacrifice; but be mindful to be preſent with the three Diſpoſitions we ſpoke of, <hi>Attention, Reſpect,</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> There are many different Ways preſcrib'd to Aſſiſt devoutly at this Holy Sacrifice; but ſuppoſing you be preſent with theſe three Conditions, and perform therein thoſe four Things we took notice of, Adoring God there profoundly, Begging Pardon of him, Rendring him Thanks for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, and Imploring his Grace for your felf and others; This is the moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Method you can follow.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Four Things ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd principally after the Conſecration, until Communion; and for the time that goes before Conſecration, you may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it in reciting ſome Prayers, or if you be capable in following the Prieſt, in all he ſhall ſay or do in every part of the Sacrifice: That is, in begging Pardon of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33523:78"/>God with him during the <hi>Introit</hi> and <hi>Kyrie eleiſon,</hi> making humble Suit to him during the Prayers, hearkning attentively to the Epiſtle and Goſpel, repreſenting unto your ſelf <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who ſpeaks unto you, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to keep in your Memory what Inſtruction you receive from his holy Word; At <hi>Credo</hi> making Profeſſion of Faith with the Prieſt, at the <hi>Offertory</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with him, at the <hi>Preface</hi> when he ſays <hi>Surſum corda,</hi> raiſing your Heart to God to keep you more attentive, and diſpoſing your ſelf to Adore our Saviour at the Conſecration, and performing the Four Things we have ſpoken of.</p>

                     <hi>Begin your Study with the Knowledge of your ſelf,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Bernard. It is in vain to extend your Knowledge to things which belong not to you, neglecting your ſelf. What doth it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage if you gain the whole World, and loſe your own Soul? Whatſoever Wiſdom you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, if it be not ſo for your felf, the greateſt part of Knowledge is wanting. Altho' you ſhould know all the higheſt Myſteries of Faith, and all the Secrets included in Nature, if you know not your ſelf, you are like to him who builds without a Foundation, preparing a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine rather than an Edifice.</hi> And it befalls them who neglect this Knowledge of themſelves, as it did that Philoſopher, who being attentive to the Conſideration of the Stars, fell into a deep Ditch, for want of looking to himſelf, and made himſelf the Object of Laughter to his Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators.</p>

                  <p>We become not Learned but by the Study of Science; and we become not vertuous, but by our Application to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. We have ſhewn above, that Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is neceſſary to learn Vertue; Now
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33523:82"/>we cannot receive Inſtructions by Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Maſters only, but alſo by Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Books. We are not always near our Paſtors and Directors, to learn from them the Way of Vertue. Their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, their Admonitions, their Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their Counſels, continue but for a time in our Memories; we eaſily loſe them, if they be not maintain'd and renew'd by the Reading of Books, and Meditation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on holy Things.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon the Wiſeman in <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus</hi> Chap. 6. after he had ſaid, that to acquire Wiſdom, we muſt hearken to the Documents of the Wiſe, adds this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Means as neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi>

Now the Sources of theſe Thoughts and Affections is the reading of pious Books, which ſerves as an Inſtrument of Divine Grace to inſpire us with them.</p>
                  <p>It was by this that God wrought that admirable Converſion of S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was by this that he wrought that wonderful Change of S. <hi>Serapion,</hi> whom the reading of the Goſpel mov'd ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he left all his Goods, and having given them to the Poor, even to his wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cloaths, he went thro' the Streets with with a New Teſtament under his Arm, ſaying, <hi>Ille me ſpoliavit; This is that which hath ſtripped me.</hi> O the great force of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reading!

                  <head type="sub">An Advertiſement concerning bad Books.</head>
                  <p>WHEN I exhort you to read good Books, I advertiſe you at the ſame time to fly abſolutely wicked ones, which we may call the Plague of Minds, next to which there is nothing more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to young Perſons.</p>
                  <p>It is one of the moſt effectual Means the Devil hath invented to corrupt Minds, and which almoſt always ſucceeds. He hath rais'd up an infinite number of all ſorts, in all Languages, in all Times, and ſtill deviſes new ones. The greateſt part are diſguis'd with the appearance of Learning or Eloquence, or of ſome ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Invention; and are by ſo much more dangerous, as under theſe Vizors they conceal a mortal Poiſon, which is deeply imbib'd in the Soul. Young Perſons read them with Pleaſure and earneſtneſs, and eaſily remember them: Diſcourſes paſs, but Books ſtill remain in their Hands;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33523:84"/>they have time to meditate on them, and ſoftly digeſt the Venom they inſpire.</p>
                  <p>The Effects are always pernicious and mortal; for ſome produce in the Mind Error, and Darkneſs; others pervert the Judgment, corrupt good Inclinations, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one judge that good which is wicked, and account that wicked which is good. Others teach Vice, excite Paſſions, inflame Concupiſcence, enkindle diſhoneſt Love in the Hearts of the moſt chaſte; and there is none which leaves not behind it much cauſe to be ſorry for reading it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Books are pernicious to all Men, but they are moſt of all hurtful to young Perſons, being they are more apt to receive the ill Impreſſions they make in the Mind; and they ought to avoid them as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the Devil, and as a deteſtable Poiſon which Hell vomits upon Earth to infect, and deſtroy Souls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theſe are all Heretical Books, which teach Errors in Faith, and which combat the Truths receiv'd by the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All wicked Books, which convert Religion and pious Things into Deriſion; which blame the Ceremonies, and receiv'd Cuſtoms thereof; which ſcoff at Perſons Confecrated to God, as Prieſts and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Thoſe which abuſe the Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture by wicked and profane Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſcivious and immodeſt Books, which wage open War againſt Chaſtity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Books which treat of Love, altho'
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33523:84"/>they be not uncivil in Words; Such are moſt of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Poets, and the greateſt part of Romances. Theſe Books are more dangerous than thoſe of the Third ſort, becauſe thoſe openly teach Wickedneſs, and eaſily breed an averſion of themſelves, in Souls which have yet the Fear of God; but theſe not ſeeming to be publickly naught, attract the Mind by their fair Diſcourſes, and by the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Things they treat of, by which delighting the Senſes, they inflame the Heart with impure Love.</p>
                  <p>Fly all theſe Books, <hi>Theotime,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Practice.</note> as Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Devil hath found out to deſtroy you. You can ſcarce ever read them without a mortal Sin; for you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entertain evil Thoughts, or expoſe your ſelf to the evident danger of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them. If you have any of theſe Books, keep them not, abſolutely part with them, notwithſtanding any Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you have made not to read them: Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity will tempt you and overcome you at the end; it is a Serpent which when you think the leaſt on it, will give you a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wound.</p>
                  <p>Say not that theſe Books are well Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that the Diſcourſe is Eloquent, that you learn there to Speak well, and many excellent Things: For I ſhall anſwer you with S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that all this is but a falſe Pretext;<note n="*" place="margin">Non omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no per hanc turpitudinem verba illa commodius diſcuntur, ſed per haec verba turpitudo iſta confidentius perpetratur. <hi>S.

                  <head type="sub">Of Pious Converſation.</head>
                  <p>THERE is yet a moſt important Means to acquire Vertue, <hi>viz.</hi> to Converſe with vertuous Perſons. Nothing hath ſo great power over the Mind as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, whether good or bad. Man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclin'd to Imitation, and to act that which he ſees others do. Now if Example hath ſuch an influence over the Mind, it is principally in Converſation, where it hath ſo much more force, by how much it is entertain'd nearer, and more frequently. And if it have ſo much power over Men, it hath a wonderful influence upon young People, as we ſee by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon one of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Advices which can be given to thoſe who aſpire to Vertue, and particularly to young Perſons, is that of pious Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It is there, <hi>Theotime,</hi> where Vertue is inſtill'd into the Mind with Pleaſure. The Example of others makes ſecret, but
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33523:85"/>ſtrong Impreſſions, which frame the Soul to Piety, without perceiving it. A Man inſenſibly embraces their Judgments and Maxims, learns to ſpeak and act like them, and believes it his Duty to do what he ſees others perform. A noble Spirit bluſhes to ſee it ſelf overcome by its Companions: And it is a ſign of a wicked Diſpoſition, and of a Mind totally abandon'd by God, when the Example of others doth not move it, and that it perſiſts in Vice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Examples of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>This moſt powerful Means is alſo taught by the Wiſeman in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> Chap. 9. <hi>Treat,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with the Wiſe and Prudent; let the juſt and vertuous Perſons be your familiar Companions.</hi> The reaſon of this Counſel is given in the <hi>Proverbs;</hi> becauſe<note n="*" place="margin">Qui cum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientibus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur ſapiens erit. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.</note> 
                     <hi>He who converſeth with the wiſe, will becom wiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there are two ſorts of vertuous Perſons with whom you ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Endeavour to Aſſociate your Self with diſcreet Perſons, who ſurpaſs you in Age as well as in Wiſdom and Vertue. It is the Advice of the Wiſeman in the words I cited now, and alſo in Chap. 6. where he ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">In multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentium ſta, &amp; ſapientiae illorum ex corde conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Frequent the Company of ancient wiſe Perſons, and ſeriouſly follow their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> That is, take pleaſure in their Society, and advantage your ſelf with their wiſe Diſcourſes, and good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gives the ſame Advice to young People in his Offices, where he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33523:86"/>ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">Plurimum itaque pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt unicuique bonis conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi.

                     <note place="margin">Sixteenth Means.</note> is one of the laſt Means which I aſſign you; but it is alſo one of the moſt effectual and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to make you live and encreaſe in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, <hi>viz.</hi> The Devotion to the Bleſſed Virgin.</p>
                  <p>Next to God, and the moſt adorable Humanity of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it is ſhe whom we muſt chiefly Honor and Love, by reaſon of that moſt ſublime and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Dignity of the Mother of God, which raiſeth her above all Creatures God hath ever created.</p>
                  <p>By her we may receive all the Aſſiſtance which is neceſſary for us. She is moſt Powerful in reſpect of God, to obtain from him all that ſhe ſhall demand of him. She is all Goodneſs in regard of us, to apply her ſelf to God for us. Being Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, he cannot refuſe her Requeſt; being our Mother, ſhe cannot deny us her Interceſſion, when we have recourſe to her. Our Miſeries move her Heart, our Neceſſities urge ger, the Prayers we offer her for our Salvation, bring to us all that we demand: And St. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath the boldneſs to ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Sileat miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordiam tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, Virgo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata, ſi quis eſt qui invocatam te in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus ſuis ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi meminer it defuiſſe. <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:33523:87"/>
                  <p>Since the Bleſſed Virgin hath ſo much Goodneſs and Mercy for all Men, we may ſay ſhe hath a very particular one for young People, whoſe Frailty ſhe knows to be the greateſt, and Neceſſities moſt urgent, chiefly for the preſervation of Chaſtity, which is moſt of all aſſaulted in that Age, and of which ſhe is a ſingular Protectreſs. Hiſtories are full of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Saints, who have conſerv'd this great Vertue in their Youth, by the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Queen of Virgins; And the Experience thereof doth daily diſcover many who have gain'd great Victories, by the recourſe they have had to her Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and who have happily advanc'd themſelves in Vertue under her Protection and Conduct.</p>
                  <p>Be therefore Devout to the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, dear <hi>Theotime;</hi> but in the Name of God let it not be the Devotion of many, who think themſelves to be Devout to the Bleſſed Virgin, in offering ordinarily ſome Prayer to her, more by Cuſtom than Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and on the otherſide do not care hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly to diſpleaſe her by a Life repleniſh'd with mortal Sins, which they commit without any ſcruple. O God! what Devotion is this to deſire to pleaſe the Mother, and daily crucifie the Son, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his Blood under their Feet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn his Grace and Friendſhip? Is not this to be an Enemy both to Son and Mother?</p>
                  <p>O dear, <hi>Theotime,</hi> your Devotion to the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33523:87"/>Bleſſed Virgin muſt not be like that,<note place="margin">True Devotion to the Bleſſed Virgin.</note> it muſt be more generous and more holy; and to ſpeak plainly, if you will be a true Child, and a ſincere Servant of the Bleſſed Virgin, you muſt have a care to perform Four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Have a great apprehenſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing her by mortal Sin, and of afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Motherly Heart, by Diſhonoring her Son, and deſtroying your Soul; and if you chance to fall into that Misfortune, have recourſe readily to her,<note n="*" place="margin">Non aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum praedul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem ingens deſiderium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undationem lacrymarum, aſſiduitatem precum quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumlibet etiam peccatorum, <hi>Si tamen laverint à malitia cor.

                     </note> that ſhe may be your Mediatrix to reconcile you to her Son, extremely provoked by you. She is the refuge of Sinners as well as of the Juſt, on Condition they have recourſe to her with a true deſire of converting themſelves, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſays.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Love and imitate her Vertues, and principally her Humility and Chaſtity. Theſe two Vertues amongſt others, have render'd her entirely pleaſing to God:<note n="*" place="margin">Agnoſcit cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, &amp; diligit diligentes ſe, &amp; prope eſt in veritate invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantibus ſe, praeſertim his quos videt ſibi conformes factos in caſtitate &amp; humilitate. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> She loves them ſingularly in her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and is delighted to aſſiſt with her Favors thoſe whom ſhe finds to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inclin'd to thoſe Vertues, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame Saint.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Have recourſe to her for things needful for your Salvation; and for that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:33523:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>end offer to her daily ſome particular Prayers, ſay your Beads or the little Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſometimes in the Week, perform ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in her Honor on every Saturday, whether Prayer, Abſtinence, or Alms; Honor particularly her Feaſts with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Communion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be mindful to Invoke her in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and in the Dangers you find your ſelf in of offending God. You cannot ſhew your reſpect for her better, than by applying your ſelf to her in theſe urgent Neceſſities, and you can find no Succor more prompt and favorable than hers. It is the Counſel of St. <hi>Bernard;</hi>

                     <hi>If the Winds of Temptations be rais'd againſt you, if you run upon the Rocks of Adverſity, lift up your Eyes towards that Star, Invoke the Bleſſed Virgin. In Dangers, in Extremities, in doubtful Affairs, think upon the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, call upon the Bleſſed Virgin, let her not depart from your Mouth, nor from your Heart: And that you may obtain the aſſiſtance of her Interceſſion, be ſure to follow the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of her Converſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you perform this, you will have a true Devotion to the Bleſſed Virgin, you will be of the number of her real Children, and ſhe will be your Mother, under whoſe Protection you ſhall never periſh. Keep well in memory that excellent Sentence of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33523:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>S. <hi>Anſelm,</hi> who preſum'd to ſay, That as it is neceſſary he muſt needs periſh, who hath no Affection to the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and who forſakes her; So it is impoſſible he ſhould periſh, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to her, and whom ſhe regards with the Eyes of Mercy.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall make an end with an excellent Example which I ſhall produce for a Proof of this Verity.<note place="margin">A Remarkable Example. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, c. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> S. <hi>Brigit</hi> had a Son who follow'd the Profeſſion of a Souldier, and was bred up in the Wars, and dy'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſhe having heard the News of his Death, was much concern'd for the Salvation of her Son, dead in ſo dangerous a Condition; and as ſhe was often ſavour'd by God with Revelations, of which alone ſhe hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a Book, ſhe was aſſur'd of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Son by enſuing Revelations. In the firſt the Bleſſed Virgin reveal'd to her, that ſhe had aſſiſted her Son with a particular Protection at the Hour of his Death, having ſtrengthned him againſt Temptations, and obtain'd all neceſſary Favors for him to make a holy and happy End. In the following ſhe declar'd the Cauſe of that ſingular Aſſiſtance ſhe gave her Son, and ſaid it was in Recompence of his great and ſincere Devotion he had teſtifi'd to her, during his Life, wherein he had lov'd her with a very ardent Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and had endeavour'd to pleaſe her in all things.</p>
                  <p>This is, <hi>Theotime,</hi> what a real Devotion to the Bleſſed Virgin did merit for this
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:33523:89"/>young Man, and for many others: She will be as prevalent for you, if you have a Devotion for her; if you love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the Bleſſed Virgin as ſhe ought to be lov'd and honor'd, in the manner we have ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>But in ſpeaking of the Devotion of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Devotion to S. <hi>Joſeph</hi> very profitable to young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> I cannot paſs by that of her dear Spouſe, the glorious S. <hi>Joſeph.</hi> This great Saint having had the ſingular Happineſs to be choſen to have the Care and Guardianſhip of the Son of God in his Infancy and Youth, it muſt needs follow that he will be favorable to young Perſons, and cheriſh them tenderly in that Age, which he ſaw ſanctifi'd by the Son of God. He hath Serv'd him in all the Neceſſities of his Life, to which he was pleas'd to ſubmit himſelf for our Love: He freed him from the Perſecutions of his Enemies, he bred him up in his Infancy, govern'd him in his Youth; He ſaw him ſubmit himſelf to his Commands; He was a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Witneſs and Admirer of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Vertues he made appear from Day to Day in his tender Years; as the Sun diſcovers his Light according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion he riſes higher.</p>
                  <p>Ought we not to believe that this Saint, who hath had ſo much Familiarity with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> when a little Child, affects with a ſingular tenderneſs the Children of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and particularly thoſe who endeavor to conform themſelves to that Divine Youth, by the imitation of his

                  <p>Fix your Affection, <hi>Theotime,</hi> upon this good Saint, and honor him with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reſpect: Take him for your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and for the Protector of your Purity.

In
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33523:96"/>theſe Meetings ſomething of Scripture is read, which ſerves to nouriſh Faith, to raiſe Hope, and ſtrengthen the Courage of the Faithful.

                  <p>Concerning which we muſt take notice, that during the Three firſt Ages of the Church, wherein She liv'd amongſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, it frequently happen'd that the Chriſtians had not any appointed Places, at leaſt public, wherein to make their Congregations, but perform'd them in private Houſes, or often in ſecret. But after it pleas'd God to give Peace and Liberty to the Church under Chriſtian Emperors, they began boldly to build Churches, where the Faithful aſſembled on <hi>Sundays</hi> and Feaſts, under the Conduct of a Paſtor, who was given them to have a care of their Souls.</p>
                  <p>It was then when the uſe of Pariſhes and of the Parochial Maſs on theſe holy Days became to appear in its luſtre; and ſince that time it hath always been conſerv'd in the Churches, and recommended to the Faithful with much care, as a thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Service of God, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33523:97"/>of Souls, for the the Inſtruction of People, and Conduct of Manners; and to conſerve the Order and Diſcipline of the Church, it hath been alſo commanded as a thing of Obligation.</p>
                  <p>This appears in the greateſt part of Councils, as well General as Particular, which have been held ſince, and lately in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which renewing and relying upon the former, in the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Orders Biſhops <hi>to</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Inſtitution of Pariſhes and Parochial Maſſes; from whence it is eaſie to gather Three things, from the ignorance of which doth ſpring the Contempt which is offer'd to them, <hi>viz.</hi> their Antiquity, End, and Obligation.</p>
                  <p>They are as ancient as the Church her ſelf. Their End, to Govern the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an People with Order, and Eaſe, every one having his proper Paſtor to watch over his Salvation, and every Paſtor his Church, which is as it were his Flock,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33523:97"/>where the Sheep are aſſembled to receive their Spiritual Suſtenance, the cure of their Diſtempers, Inſtructions and neceſſary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions; briefly, to hear by his Voice, that of the Sovereign Paſtor of Souls, whoſe Place he repreſents. And as to the Obligation, it is ſufficient to manifeſt by the End of that Inſtruction ſo neceſſary for the Salvation of Souls, and Decrees of Councils ſo often repeated, make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that it is very ſtrict, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great and juſt Cauſe, one cannot be therein diſpenſed.</p>
                  <p>Things being thus, is it not a thing worthy of aſtoniſhment, to ſee ſo holy and neceſſary an Inſtitution neglected and deſpis'd after ſuch a manner, that it ſeems as if Pariſhes were but for a few of the meaner ſort, for aged Men, and young Girls? and that Chriſtians ſhould now adays contemn a thing, the privation whereof was heretofore a Puniſhment for the greateſt Crimes.</p>
                  <p>This Contempt befalls many for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reaſons. Some do it out of a pure want of Devotion, which makes them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the length of the Pariſh Maſs upon a Day dedicated to Piety, and ſeek a ſhort one that they may employ the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Holy Day in Idleneſs, in Vanities and Recreations. What ſhame is it for Chriſtians to make ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſanctification of Feaſts, of the Ordinances of God and of his Church, and of their own Salvation, that they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:33523:98"/>ſhould rather chooſe miſerably to ſpend the time of the Service of God in Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, than to employ it in the Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and the ſanctification of their Souls, and to learn ſomething for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It is a deplorable Diſorder which made St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">Obſervemus diem domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam &amp; ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficemus illam.

                  <p>Others deſpiſe this Obligation by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Pride, which makes them affect a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Liberty to go where they pleaſe on thoſe Holy Days, a Liberty which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Licentiouſneſs, and a Rebellion to the Orders of the Church,<note n="*" place="margin">O libertas ſervitute om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ſervitior! quae me peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſime addicat ſuperbiae ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vituti; plus ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo dentes lapi quam vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gam Paſtoris: Advertens nimirum cruenta beſtia quae circuit quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens quem devoret, elongatam cuſtodiam; heu ſtatim incidit in praeſumptorem. <hi>S.

                  <p>There are others who excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by reaſon of their Affairs; But it is a very ſtrange thing, that Chriſtians, who have no Affair of greater Importance than their Salvation, after they have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all the Week in temporal Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, ſhould not allot the <hi>Sunday,</hi> which God hath reſerv'd for his Service to the Divine Worſhip, and Salvation of their Souls. This Excuſe is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but not to be allow'd, neither will it be accepted in the ſight of God. I would gladly ask thoſe Perſons, whether they pretend to be exempt from the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sunday?</hi> God hath given Six Days to Men to Labor, he would have us reſt upon the Seventh Day, to apply our ſelves entirely to religious Actions, and particularly to Three; To give him Honor, To ſanctifie our Souls, And to Meditate upon the eternal Repoſe which we muſt purchaſe in this Life. I demand, where is that ceaſing from Labor, and that application to pious things? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be to ſanctifie a Holy Day, or rather employ it totally in Buſineſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the time of a ſhort Maſs, oftentimes heard with a Mind full of diſtractions? I beſeech thoſe who live thus, to make the following Reflection, and conſider well that Admonition of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in the place
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33523:99"/>which I have already cited, where he ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">Ideo à ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis patribus noſtris conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum eſt Chriſtianis &amp; mandatum ut in ſolemnita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus ſancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, &amp; maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis diebus oti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um haberent &amp; à terreno negotio vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ut pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiores &amp; promptiores eſſent, ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum cultum cum non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berent quod eos inde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardaret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodum, relinquerentque eo tempore terrenam ſollicitudinem quo facilius poſſent Dei intendere voluntatem.

                     <hi>Chriſtians are commanded to repoſe upon Feſtival Days, and principally upon Sundays, to be the better diſpos'd to the Service of God, and to ceaſe upon thoſe Days from temporal Affairs, that they may apply themſelves more eaſily to God, as he himſelf exhorts us by that Saying of the Prophet, Ceaſe from Labor, and conſider that I am God; but thoſe who by the Embroilment of Cares and Affairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn this Exhortation of God, and refuſe to apply themſelves to holy Things, give us a great reaſon to doubt, that at the Day of Judgment, when they ſhall knock at the Gate, it will be anſwer'd them, I know you not, be gon from hence, you who work Iniquity; and that thus they ſhall be then rejected by God, as they were negligent in ſearching after him, when it was in their power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, there are others who abſent themſelves from their Pariſhes on <hi>Sundays</hi> and ſolemn Feaſts, under pretence of Piety, ſome ſaying that they have more Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion elſewhere than in the Pariſh; others by reaſon of ſome Congregation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity which hinders them from being preſent there; others have their Ghoſtly Father ſomewhere elſe.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:33523:99"/>
                  <p>But the Firſt ought to know, that the ſenſible Devotion is not always the moſt ſolid, it having frequently more of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation than of Truth; and what they ſay they have, which makes them neglect and depart from the Orders of the Church, is not a Devotion, but rather an Illuſion.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Second, I maintain, that it is an Abuſe to prefer the Works of Counſel before thoſe of Obligation; and that God loves Obedience better than Sacrifice; that is, the Works commanded, better than the Devotions which come from our proper Inclination: And that it is a ſtrange thing, that there being ſo many other times in the Week, and on the Feaſts themſelves to ſatisfie their free Devotions, one ſhould employ therein the Days, and even Hours, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Duties of the Pariſh.</p>
                  <p>To the Third I anſwer, that it were often better for them to have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in the Pariſh, altho' it were only to practiſe Submiſſion, and give good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this Action. But if for good and ſolid Reaſons they Confeſs themſelves to others, which they ought to do as often as is poſſible by the Advice of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, they ought to manage their time ſo well, that this freedom which is allow'd them, may not hinder them from aſſiſting at the Pariſh upon Holy Days, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there the Example and Edification which the Church requires of them.</p>
                  <p>For Concluſion, <hi>Theotime,</hi> I exhort you
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:33523:100"/>to be faithful and diligent in your Pariſh Church, and not to abſent your ſelf for any of the Reaſons I have ſpoken. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her as your Mother, who hath brought you ſort to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by holy Baptiſm, and Educated you in Chriſtianity: She is charged with the care of your Soul, ſhe muſt anſwer for you to God, ſhe muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you during your Life to the Point of Salvation, and aſſiſt you at the Hour of Death. Love her tenderly as a Child loves his Mother, be obedient to her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from her your ſpiritual Suſtenance of Doctrin, and of the holy Sacraments; walk under her Eye and Government, with Reſpect and Confidence; receive from others all the aſſiſtance you can, but expect from her your principal Conduct, and be zealous to follow that great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Obedite Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitis veſtris &amp; ſubjacete eis: Ipſi enim pervigilant quaſi ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem pro ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabus veſtris reddituri, ut cum gaudio hoc faciant, &amp; non gementes, hoc enim non expedit vobis. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note>

                  <p>THE firſt Hindrance of the Salvation of young Perſons, is Ignorance, or want of Inſtruction. We muſt know a Good, that we may love it; and to know it, it is neceſſary we ſhould be Inſtructed therein, we not being able to our ſelves to learn it, who bring nothing with us into the World but Ignorance and Sin. God
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33523:101"/>ſays by his Prophet, that<note n="a" place="margin">Propterea captivus du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuts eſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus meus, quia non habuit ſcientiam. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>his People were ſent into Captivity, becauſe they had not Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> that is, the Inſtruction and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Salvation.

                     <hi>where there is no Science, there is no good for the Salvation of Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Impediment is great, and it is the firſt Fountain of the corruption of Youth. It is by ſo much more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd, as it is common and extended to many; it being certain, that the greateſt part of Youth is loſt for want of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and not being ſolidly Train'd up in the Maxims of Vertue. Fathers neglect to Inſtruct their Children in true Piety, and beſtow all their Care in Educating them in Vanity, in Pleaſures, in the love of Earthly Goods, and in the Maxims of the World. Maſters employ often the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their Labor to advance their Scholars in Learning, and very little to make them underſtand the Science of Salvation; Children concern themſelves little to be Inſtructed, and frequently fly Inſtruction all they can; which is the reaſon why they continue in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in wicked Habits, and are loſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy.</p>
                  <p>For the Proof of this Verity, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you here two Examples quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.<note n="*" place="margin">Quis enim hominum non extollebat laudibus tunc patrem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quod ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra vires rei familiaris ſuae impenderet fillo, quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid etiam longè pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinanti ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diorum cauſa opus eſſet? cum interea non ſatageret idem pater qualis creſcerem tibi; aut quam caſtus eſſem, dummodo leſſem diſertus, aut potius deſertus à cultura tua Deus! qui es unus verus, &amp; bonus Dominus agri cordis mei. <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Conf. cap.</hi> 3.</note> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> in his Confeſſions deploring the Corruption of his Youth, attributes a great cauſe of it to the want of Inſtruction, and to the blindneſs of his Father, who uſing all Endeavors to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:33523:102"/>his Son in his Studies, and make him Learned and Eloquent, neglected in the mean time the moſt neceſſary thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the Care of his Manners, and of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in Vertue, without which all Science could but ſerve to render him more diſpleaſing to God, and more remov'd from his Grace.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, the Scripture making a recital of the generous Action of chaſt <hi>Suſanna,</hi> who choſe rather to expoſe her ſelf to the falſe Accuſations of thoſe two infamous old Men, and to be proſecuted to Death, than to Sin in the ſight of God, by conſenting to a deteſtable Crime, which thoſe wretched Men ſolicited her to, attributed the Cauſe of this holy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her Piety, and to her Inſtruction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from her Parents; the Words it makes uſe of are remarkable:<note n="*" place="margin">Joachim ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit uxorem nomine Suſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, filiam Helciae, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chram nimis &amp; timentem Deum; parentes enim ejus cum effent juſti, erudie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt filiam ſuam ſecundum legem Moyſi. <hi>Dan.</hi> 13.</note>

                  <head type="sub">The Second Obſtacle, the too much Indulgence of Parents, their ill Example, and the bad Inſtruction they give their Children.</head>
                  <p>IT is but too true, that the Ruin of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſprings moſt commonly from the Fault of Parents, who are wanting in this great Obligation God hath impos'd upon them, of Educating them in his Fear, and diſpoſing them to Vertue.</p>
                  <p>Now there are four Defects which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may be guilty of in this Obligation, which moſt frequently are the Cauſe of the Corruption and Ruin of Children.<note place="margin">Four Faults Parents may commit in the Inſtruction of their Children.</note>1. When they neglect to Inſtruct them in the knowledge of Vertue and their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. When they are too Indulgent in their Place, giving too much Liberty, and not Correcting them when they do ill.

                  <p>As to the Second, it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd how common this Fault is amongſt Parents, and how it daily deſtroys Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, appears by Experience. The greateſt part of fathers and Maſters affect their Children with a fooliſh and blind Love, which regards nothing but the preſent and ſenſible Good of their Children, and are afraid to give them the leaſt trouble, by keeping them within the Bounds of Vertue by a diſcreet Admonition, or by a reaſonable Correction; they chooſe rather to leave them in their wicked Inclinations, which for want of Correction encreaſing with Age, make them wicked and vicious for all the remainder of this Life, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable after this Life for all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Misfortunate Parents! who by this ſort of Mildneſs precipitate themſelves with their Children, into the deep Pit of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; like thoſe fooliſh Animals, which kill their young ones by the vehemence of embracing them. Blind Fathers, who ſee not that this Mercy you ſhew to your Children, is the greateſt Cruelty you can exerciſe in your Condition; and you would not be ſo cruel, if you took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Life with your own Hands; it being certain, that by this Inhumanity you would but deſtroy their Bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by your Mildneſs you cauſe the ruin
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:33523:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>of their Souls, and the eternal loſs of their Salvation. The time will come wherein your Children will lay their Curſes on you, will require of God revenge againſt you, and will accuſe you as the Authors of their Misfortune; witneſs he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condemn'd to Death, cry'd out aloud, <hi>It is not the Judge, but my Mother, who is the Cauſe of my Puniſhment.</hi>

Upon your ſelves, becauſe you have neither Inſtructed nor Corrected them, when they ſtood in need. Upon your Children, becauſe they made uſe of your Indulgence, to give themſelves over to vice and Diſorder.</p>
                  <p>See the Example of the High Prieſt <hi>Heli</hi> recounted above, and learn from that terrible Puniſhment God laid upon him, what you ought to expect: For all the Miſeries which beſel as well him as his Children and his whole Houſe, and for their firſt and principal Source, the great Indulgence he had towards his Children, not Correcting them for their Sins: This is the Teſtimony God himſelf gives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; <hi>I will judge,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Houſe of Heli,</hi>

                  <p>I cannot ſufficiently exaggerate this Fault of Parents, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to raiſe in you ſo great a horror as it deſerves.<note place="margin">Practice.</note> It is to admoniſh you, if God hath beſtow'd upon you wiſe and vertuous Parents, who have had a great care to Inſtruct you in Vertue, to Reprehend you when you were faulty, that you acknowledge the Obligation you owe to God, and make good uſe of this high Favor, by rendring your ſelf pliable, and eaſie to be Inſtructed by their Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions. But on the contrary, if your Parents, forgetful of their own Duty and your Salvation, fail to reprehend you when you commit any Miſdemeanor, have a great care leſt you be ruin'd by their misfortunate Indulgence. Beg of God very earneſtly that he would change their Diſpoſition, and give you Maſters who would ſupply their Defect, and take notice of your Actions to redreſs them, when you ſhall wander never ſo little out of the Path of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>I ſay the ſame, if your Parents be not only negligent in reprehending you, but what is yet worſe, if they give you ill Example, teaching you, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, by their Actions, to love the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this Life, to deſire Riches without meaſure, to affect Vanity, to be Proud, Ambitious, Cholerick, ſeeking Revenge, not ſuffering the leaſt Injury, Immodeſt in Words, addicted to Feaſting, to Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, to Impurity, and other like things. And yet more, if they be ſo miſerable as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:33523:104"/>to teach you by their Diſcourſes, one or many Vices, approve or praiſe them when you have committed them. O God, dear Child, ſtand in fear of all theſe Occaſions, you cannot be in a greater danger of your Salvation; and having recourſe to God, beſeech him that he would illuminate you to diſcern Good from Evil, that he would ſtrengthen your Mind againſt the bad Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions you ſhall receive, and not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by their Fault, who ought to be the firſt who ſhould contribute to your Salvation.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Fourth Obſtacle, Inconſtancy.</head>
                  <p>IF Untractableneſs be very common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt young People, Inconſtancy in Good is yet more frequent, and it puts a very great Impediment to your Salvation. Some young Spirits are found tractable and pliable to receive Inſtructions, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and Admonitions, but there are few who are firm and conſtant to obſerve them well.</p>
                  <p>They have a Spirit ſubject to change, which adheres to all ſorts of Objects, lets it ſelf be carry'd away by all its firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be toſſed by divers Paſſions, which permit it not to continue long in the ſame courſe. They are ſcarce able to make one ſolid Reſolution, chiefly in that which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:33523:107"/>concerns Vertue, much leſs form or Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it when it is made, the firſt Occaſion carries them away, and makes them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all their good Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>If Inconſtancy be not corrected in good time, it puts a great Obſtacle to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of young People, and abſolutely hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from learning Vertue. Seed cannot take root in a moving Sand, nor Vertue in a light Mind, which changes upon all Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon the Wiſeman gives you that admirable Advertiſement, <hi>Theotime;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in omnem ventum, &amp; non eas in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem viam. Eſto firmus in via Domini. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Inconſtancy in God ſprings prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from three Cauſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From a Levity natural to that Age,<note place="margin">Three Cauſes of Inconstancy.</note> which renders young Perſons inconſtant in all their Actions. They are changeable in all their Inclinations, in their Thoughts, in their Deſigns, and in their Reſolutions; hence it comes that they are ſo inconſtant in Good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſprings from this, that they are not ſolidly convinc'd of the Importance of their Salvation, and of the neceſſity they have of addicting themſelves to Vertue in their Youth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It comes from the want of Conduct, and from this, that they not being capable to Conduct themſelves, take not the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of others for the guidance of their
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:33523:108"/>Life, or if they take it, it is but for a ſhort time, they ſoon reject it, abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Motions of their inconſtant Mind.</p>
                  <p>For the cure of this Inconſtancy, there is to be apply'd a Remedy to theſe three Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then,<note place="margin">Its Remedy.</note> 
                     <hi>Theotime,</hi> endeavor to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect in your ſelf as much as you can, that natural Levity of your Age, which makes you ſubject to mutation in the greateſt part of your Actions. Be conſtant in all that you perform; change not eaſily your Reſolutions, your Enterpriſes, nor your Employments, except with Reaſon and Counſel: In a word, govern your ſelf by Reaſon, and not by Fancy and Caprichio.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Labor to fix your Mind in Piety by good Thoughts, and frequent Reflections on your Salvation, and on the neceſſity you have to live vertuouſly in your Youth; the reading of the Firſt Part of this Book will ſerve for that end.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">An important Advice.</note> Submit your ſelf to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a wiſe Confeſſor; Follow his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and the Rule of Life he ſhall preſcribe to you; Give him an Account of your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from time to time, that he may ſet you in a good Way when you are out of it; Perform nothing, of how little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence ſoever, without his Counſel, or that of ſome other prudent Perſon.</p>

                  <p>AMongſt the Means the Devil hath invented to pervert Souls, there is none which he makes a greater advantage of, to keep them ſecurely in Vice than a Shame to do Good; a Shame by which he deplorably ſeduces Mens Minds, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally young Perſons; who being by the tenderneſs of their Age more apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Impreſſions of Fear and Shame, give Occaſion to that miſerable Spirit,<note place="margin">Omne malum aut pudore aut timore natura ſuffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. <hi>Tertul. in Apol.</hi>
                     </note> maliciouſly to abuſe their Facility, and natural Shameſac'dneſs to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Shame and Confuſion in reſpect of Piety and Vertue, which was only made for Sin.</p>
                  <p>For this effect he puts into their mind theſe falſe and vain Imaginations, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Means the Devil uſes to raiſe Shame in young Perſons.</note> That Vertue is contemn'd amongſt Men, That they are little eſteem'd who follow
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:33523:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>it, That if they ſhould apply themſelves to do well, they ſhould be deſpis'd, yea, even mockt at. He actually repreſents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their thoughts the Contempt and Scoffs of others; and by theſe Artifices he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws them from the Way of Vertue, ſtopping and ſtifling in them by this fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Shame, all the good Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires they had conceiv'd concerning their Salvation. And ſometimes this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Shame gets ſuch powerful poſſeſſion over their Minds, that they not only bluſh to do Good, and appear Vertuous, but even glory in their Vices, and have a kind of Confuſion not to be as Wicked as the moſt Vicious; as it happen'd to S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> who deplores his Misfortune and Blindneſs in this Point, in the Second Book of his Confeſſions, Chap. 3. We ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his Words in the following Chapter.</p>
                  <p>If this pernicious Shame hath taken poſſeſſion of your Mind, you muſt account it for one of the greateſt Obſtacles of your Salvation; and if you labor not in good time to over come it, it will infallibly deſtroy you. Now to conquer it, arm your ſelf againſt it with theſe Reflections.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> Why do you bluſh? Are you aſham'd of Vertue and the Service of God,<note place="margin">Dilectio Dei honorabilis ſapientia. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.</note> than which there is nothing more Honorable in the World? You account it a Glory to Serve a Prince upon Earth, and will you bluſh at the Service of the King of Heaven, your Sovereign Lord, to whom you owe all that you are? What ſtrange Blindneſs
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33523:109"/>is this! But take notice, that one never bluſhes, except it be for ſome thing which is either Wicked or Indecent, or too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or unworthy of ones Self: So that if you are aſham'd of Vertue, you put it into the rank of one of theſe; What an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity is this!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Before whom do you bluſh? Before the Wicked, whoſe Judgment is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverted, who judge that to be wicked which is good, and that good which is wicked, having no other Rule for their Opinion than their deprav'd Inclinations. If they contemn you, it is becauſe they hate Vertue, and thoſe who follow it.<note n="*" place="margin">Execratio peccatori cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Dei. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1.32. Deteſtantur ſtulti eos qui fugiunt mala. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20.

                     <hi>The Service of God is an Execration to Sinners,</hi> ſays the Wiſeman. <hi>Fools deteſt thoſe who fly from Vice. It is ordinary, that he who walks in the Path of Vertue, and fears God, ſhould be deſpis'd by the World and wicked Perſons, who follow the infamous Track of Vice.</hi> If the Eſteem of Men move you, why ſeek you not after the Eſteem of wiſe and vertuous Men, who reſpect and honor you when you do well?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Call to mind that dreadful Menace which the Son of God gave to all thoſe who bluſh at his Service;<note n="*" place="margin">Qui erubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit me &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones meos, hunc filius ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis erube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcet, cum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerit in maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſua. <hi>Luc.</hi> 9.</note> 
                     <hi>He who ſhall be aſham'd of me, and my words, I will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd of him when I ſhall come in glory;</hi> that is, he will not acknowledge them for his. Remember that fearful Confuſion which at the Day of Judgment will cover the Face of thoſe who have bluſh'd in this Life at the Service of God, when their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:33523:110"/>Sins ſhall be expos'd to the view of the whole World; and that for the Shame they had for Vertue.<note n="*" place="margin">Dabo vobis in opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſempiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniam aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam quae nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one delebitur. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 40.</note> they ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd to an eternal Diſgrace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which ſhall never be blotted out of the memory of the Angels and Saints, as the Scripture teſtifies.</p>
                  <p>O dear Child, demand frequently of God,<note place="margin">Practice.</note> that he would ſtrengthen your Mind againſt this Misfortune, which is nothing but the pure Imagination of a weak Spirit. Accuſtom your ſelf betimes to perform good Works freely, without regarding what others ſpeak or eſteem of them. Deſpiſe their Contempts, and mock at their Scoffs, and reflect what a great Folly it is to prefer the Eſteem of Men before your Eternal Salvation; and to pleaſe a ſmall number of lewd Men, not to value the Diſpleaſure of all wiſe Perſons, of all the Saints in Heaven, and of God himſelf. Weigh well this Reflection.</p>

                     <p>O God! is it poſſible that this malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirit finds no Inſtruments more powerful to deſtroy Men, than Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? nor to make uſe of as Servants and Miniſters to execute againſt their own Brethren, the Rage he has conceiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and the Deſign he hath laid to draw them, together with himſelf into Eternal Damnation?

                  <p>THIS, <hi>Theotime,</hi> is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Obſtacles of your Salvation, and that which produceth, or nouriſheth all the precedent and many others. Idleneſs brings Ignorance and want of Inſtruction, which cannot be gotten without Labor. It is that which breeds Untractableneſs; for a ſlothful Mind will learn nothing: The apprehenſion it hath of taking pains, makes it eſteem it ſelf ſufficiently Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and refuſe to receive the Inſtruction and Counſel of others.<note n="a" place="margin">Sapientior ſibi piger vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur ſeptem viris loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.16.</note>

Idleneſs ordinarily is the Mother of that misfortunate Sin, which ſo deplorably deſtroys a great part of Youth, the Sin of Impurity, of which we ſhall ſpeak in the following Chapter.</p>
                  <p>In a word, There are no Sins, no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, no Occaſions of Deſtruction, whereof Idleneſs is not the cauſe, and brings with it. This is the reaſon which made S. <hi>Bernard</hi> juſtly call it,<note n="d" place="margin">Omnium cogitationum malarum, &amp; tentationum, &amp; inutilium ſentina, mater nugarum, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verca virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, mors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae, vivi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, ſentina omnium ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Alas, <hi>Theotime,</hi> is it not a very deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing,<note place="margin">How common amongſt young Perſons.</note> to ſee the Sin which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſo many Evils, to be ſo common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Youth, that it ſeems to become natural to them! You ſee the greateſt part live after an idle and negligent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, flying from Labor like Death it ſelf, not applying themſelves to any conſtant Exerciſe; or if they undertake any, they preſently abandon it, or at beſt acquit themſelves very ill of it. They have no affection nor thought but for Pleaſures and Divertiſements. Playing, Walking, Good-chear, Sleeping, are the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Employments of their Life, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33523:115"/>the moſt ſerious Occupations of their Minds.</p>
                  <p>And from thence ſpring all the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into which we daily ſee them fall,<note place="margin">How pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> the unbridled Affection to the Pleaſures of this Life, the Diſreliſhing of Vertue, the Ignorance of the moſt neceſſary things, the Forgetfulneſs of God and Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From thence wicked Companions, and the Occaſions of Debauches; From thence all Vices and all bad Inclinations, which encreaſe in their Souls more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly than ill Weeds in a fertil Earth, which the Gardners Hand neglects to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate; And from thence, in fine, it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that they become unuſeful for any Good, which by their Labor they might have made themſelves capable of, and that the Vices contracted by the Idleneſs of their Youth, renders them wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable all the remainder of their Life.</p>
                  <p>I would to God it were as eaſie to root out Vice from the Souls of young People, as it is facil to make appear the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effects and vicious Conſequences of it.

For this end fortifie your Mind againſt this Vice by the following Reflections,<note place="margin">The Remedy.</note> which I beſeech you to read often and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">

                     </note> Conſider that all Men are born for Labor, God hath oblig'd them thereto by a ſolemn Sentence which he pronounc'd at the beginning of the World. If then you would be exempt, leading an Idle Life, you reſiſt the Will of God, and break the Order he hath ſo ſolemnly Eſtabliſh'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Men be oblig'd to Labor all their Life-time, they have yet a ſtricter Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to it during their Youth; becauſe if that Age be not Exercis'd in vertuous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, it heaps up many Vices and wicked Habits, which continue all the reſt of their Life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Chiefly young Men.</note> Becauſe Youth is the proper time to cultivate the Mind, and form it for Good, and wherein only they may make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves capable of an Employment where they may buſie all the ſucceeding time of their Life. If this Time be once loſt, it can never be repair'd. Time loſt in any Age, never returns; but there is this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that Time loſt in other Ages may ſometimes be recover'd, but Time loſt in Youth is irreparable.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:33523:116"/>

There you will diſtinctly diſcover all the Diſorders which have ſprung from that firſt Fault; the Ignorances it hath caus'd in you, the Sins it hath made you commit, the Vices where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have been involv'd, all the Goods you have been render'd incapable of: What have you to anſwer to all theſe things?</p>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33523:117"/>that their Miſery doth not move you, and that you will not grow wiſe at other Mens Expence, learning by their Example, to avoid that irreparable Misfortune into which they are faln by their Idleneſs?</p>
                  <p>O dear Child, for the love you ought to have for your Salvation, fly abſolutely this Vice, I beſeech you, which is one of the greateſt Impediments you could put; And that you may remember to avoid it, remember to perform two things. The Firſt is,<note place="margin">Two Practices againſt Idleneſs.</note> To apply your ſelf to ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Exerciſe, which may keep you buſi'd for the Time of your Youth; and that you may perform it as you ought, ſee what we have ſpoken of it above in Part 2. Chap. 12. The Second is, That you take care as much as you can, never to be Idle any more, without doing ſomething; uſe conſtantly ſome Action, whether of Labor wherein you are engag'd, or Reading, or Divertiſement. Let your Recreations be accompany'd with Actions either of Body or Mind. The Devil ſeeks no better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity than to find you Idle, that he may tempt and ſupriſe you. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon practiſe diligently that excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of S. <hi>Jerom,</hi>

                     <p>The Author of the Book <hi>De bono pudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citiae,</hi> attributed to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> deſcribes briefly a great number of the misfortunate Effects of this Sin: For he ſays, that<note n="*" place="margin">Impudicitia ſemper eſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtanda, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoenum ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens miniſtris ſuis, nec cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens, nec ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis debellatis propriis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, totum hominem ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſub trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phum libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis mittit, blanda prius ut plus noceat, dum placet.

                        <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty is a deteſtable Paſſion, which ſpares neither Souls nor Bodies, which renders Men abſolutely Slaves of diſhoneſt Love, flattering them at the beginning, that it might more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually deſtroy them. When it hath gotten
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:33523:119"/>poſſeſſion of their Hearts, it drains their Goods together with their Shamefac'dneſs; It excites Paſſions even to exceſs, it deſtroys a good Conſcience, it is the Mother of Impenitence, the loſs and ruin of the beſt part of Age,</hi> that is, of Youth.</p>
                     <p>Omitting the Damage that Sin cauſes to the Body, Honor and Poſſeſſions, I ſhall inſiſt only upon the dreadful Effects it produces in the Soul, which I reduce to Five or Six.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is,<note place="margin">Firſt Effect, the deſtruction of the Fear of God.</note> the deſtruction of the Fear of God, which it works in the Soul, and the ruin of all good Inclinations. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhews this Effect ſo common, that we need not ſeek any other Proof; we ſee many young People well Educated, who have very good Inclinations in their Youth, an averſion from Evil, a great affection to Piety, the Fear of God ſtrongly imprinted in their Souls: Now all theſe good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remain, if the Sin of Impurity doth not take poſſeſſion of their Heart; but when that hath once enter'd into their Mind, it entirely ſubverts them. It creeps in firſt by immodeſt Thoughts, the Thoughts produce the deſire of wanton Pleaſures, the Deſire moves to unchaſt Actions, theſe Sins repeated and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, ruin all the good Inclinations; things now appear far otherwiſe than before, the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:33523:120"/>Sin now ſeems no more ſo great, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more familiar to them; and ſuch an one who before had a great apprehenſion of one ſole mortal Sin, when he is once overcome by this brutiſh Paſſion, is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd to commit them by hundreds and thouſands. O God, what a Change, what a ſubverſion is this of a Conſcience!</p>
                     <p>The Second Effect of this Sin,<note place="margin">Second Effect. A Diſreliſh of Vertue.</note> is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſhing, and even an Averſion to Vertue, and to all pious and wholſom Things. It is not to be conceiv'd how thoſe who are infected with this Vice, have an averſion to Divine Things and Salvation. Prayer is tedious to them, and Sacraments contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, the Word of God moves them not, reading of pious Books is inſupportable. This is too manifeſt by Experience, and no wonder, <hi>Theotime,</hi> he who is Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with a Fever, takes no delight in the moſt delicious Meats; on the contrary, they ſeem to him bitter, becauſe his Taſt is deprav'd with ſome bitter Quality. Thus he who is once ſeis'd by this burning Fever of Impurity, finds a wonderful loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſlike of all the moſt pious and wholſome Things, by reaſon he hath his Heart infected with carnal and impure Affections; which permit him not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the ſweetneſs of holy Things.<note n="a" place="margin">Animalis homo non per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit ea quae Dei ſunt.</note> 
                        <hi>The natural man,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Motions of the Animal or Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part, <hi>taſts not the things which are of God.</hi> And<note n="b" place="margin">Qui ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum carnem ſunt quae car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ſunt ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note>

                     <p>The Third Effect is a Blindneſs of Mind which this Sin produces in the Soul,<note place="margin">Third Effect, Blindneſs of Mind.</note> which hinders her from diſcerning Good from Bad, and judging of things as ſhe ought. It is impoſſible that a Mind once poſſeſs'd by that Paſſion, ſhould not have its Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perverted, and ſhould not determin of things of Salvation quite contrary to Truth: The Tie and Inclination it hath to that Sin, makes it not account it ſo great an Evil (for we ordinarily judg accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Inclinations) and that it can withdraw it ſelf when it pleaſes; it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it from ſeeing the wicked Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Misfortunes this Vice brings after it. It takes away the remembrance of the Divine Judgments, and frequently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to take God himſelf out of their Minds, that they may Sin more freely, as it is obſerv'd of thoſe infamous old Men, who attempted to corrupt the Chaſtity of modeſt <hi>Suſanna.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Exarſerunt concupiſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ejus &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verterunt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum ſuum, &amp; declinaverunt oculos ſuos ut non viderent coelum neque recordarentur judiciorum juſtorum. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.</note> 
                        <hi>They being inflam'd with Concupiſcence,</hi> ſays the Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>loſt their Senſe and Judgment, and caſt down their Eyes, that they might not look towards Heaven, and remember the juſt Judgments of God.</hi> This is the proper and peculiar Effect of Immodeſty; it blinds the Mind, and makes it hoodwink it ſelf, flifling in it ſelf all good Thoughts, that it might ſin with a greater liberty, and with leſs remorſe of Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>See the Account St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> gives of himſelf concerning this Subject, in his Second Book of Confeſſions, Chap. 2.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:33523:121"/>which I have cited Part 1. Chap. 13. Artic. 2.</p>
                     <p>From this Blindneſs of Mind ſprings Pride,<note place="margin">Fourth Effect, Pride.</note> the Fourth Effect of this Sin of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, which hindering the Mind from knowing its own Good, makes it deſpiſe all Admonitions, reſiſt all Documents, and ſcoff at the moſt wholſom Counſels.<note place="margin">Cereus in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium flecti, monitoribus aſper.</note> So that as this Sin renders young Spirits ſoft and pliable to Vice, it makes them inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and obdurate to the Advertiſements of their Salvation. The Wiſeman teaches you this Truth, which Experience alſo makes ſufficiently appear.<note n="*" place="margin">Verbum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque audie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſcius lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabit, &amp; ad ſe adjiciet, audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit luxurioſus &amp; diſpiciet illi &amp; projiciet illud poſt dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum ſuum. <hi>Eocl.</hi> 2.18.</note>

                     <p>The Fifth Effect is an Obdurateneſs of the Will in Wickedneſs.<note place="margin">Fifth Effect, Obdurateneſs in Evil.</note> According to the meaſure that Sin multiplies, the Soul habituates her ſelf, and becomes obdurate, ſo that nothing is able to ſoften her. It would be an incredible thing, if we did not daily ſee it moſt apparently, how thoſe who are poſſeſs'd with this Sin, become
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:33523:121"/>ſtupid and obdurate. They are found inſenſible of all good Motions, deaf to all Inſpirations of Grace; the Menaces of Divine Juſtice and Chaſtiſements ſeem to them but Dreams; witneſs the two Sons-in-law of <hi>Lot,</hi>

The Examples of thoſe whom God hath ſo rigorouſly puniſh'd for this Sin, touch them not at all; the Misfortunes which they ſee with their own Eyes to befall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers like themſelves, make no Impreſſions upon their Minds; nothing is capable to move them, as ſoon as this brutiſh Paſſion moſt dreadfully takes poſſeſſion.<note place="margin">Obſurduerant ſtridore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenae mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis meae poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſuperbiae animae meae. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Conf. cap.</hi> 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Alas</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>) <hi>the Chain of violent Paſſions wherewith this mortal Fleſh kept me captive, made ſuch a noiſe about me, that I was deaf to all that might advertiſe me for my good.

                     <p>After all theſe dreadful Effects of the Sin of Immodeſty, there remains one,<note place="margin">Sixth Effect, Final Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</note> which is the accompliſhment of all the former, and the Mark at which they all aim, <hi>viz.</hi> Final Impenitency, or Death in mortal Sin; which is the greateſt and utmoſt of all Misfortunes. It is, O <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> a moſt common, and moſt ordinary
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:33523:122"/>Effect of this deteſtable Sin, which inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly fills Hell with a vaſt number of wretched Souls, which by untimely Deaths it caſts into that endleſs Pit: Some dying ſurpris'd with Sickneſs, which deprives them of the Time or Means to do Penance; Others ſeis'd by ſome frightful Accident; Others departing in Obdurateneſs, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by God in puniſhment of their Sins. Give ear to what the Scripture ſpeaks of thoſe, and in the Name of God imprint deeply in your Heart thoſe aſtoniſhing Words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>

                     <p>To theſe Examples, which are taken out of the Sacred Scripture, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence moſt certain, I might add many others with which Hiſtories abundantly furniſh us. I ſhall content my ſelf with two, which I have choſen out amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is recounted by St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Dialogues. He ſaith,<note place="margin">S. Greg. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Dial. cap. <hi>35.</hi>
                        </note> there was one in his time, nam'd <hi>Chryſorius,</hi> a Man of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and very rich; but as much abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Vices as he was wealthy in Riches; but above all extreamly addicted to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt Pleaſures: God reſolving to put a period to thoſe Sins he daily heap'd up one after another, ſends him a ſevere Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:33523:124"/>of which he died, but with a Death very extraordinary. Approaching to the greateſt extremity of his Diſtemper, he ſuddenly perceiv'd a multitude of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirits, who preſented themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in hideous Forms, and made a ſhew as if they would immediately carry him into Hell. He began to tremble, look agaſt, and lamentably cry out for ſuccour; he turns himſelf on every ſide to avoid the ſight of thoſe horrid Shapes, but which way ſoever he mov'd, they were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before his Eyes. After many ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, feeling himſelf preſs'd, and violent hands laid on him by thoſe wicked Spirits, he began horribly to cry out, <hi>Truce till Morning, Truce till Morning;</hi> and ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, his Soul was torn from his Body, and he miſerably departed without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Truce he requir'd. O Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, the Mother of Impenitence!</p>
                     <p>If this Example be terrible, that which follows is yet more frightful, and ought to move you more powerfully. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>John Gerſon</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Paris,</hi> who took it out of <hi>Thomas Cantipratenſis</hi> Suffragan Biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> who ſays he was an Eye-witneſs of it.</p>
                     <p>He ſays, That being a young Scholar, he had a Companion of his Studies, with whom he had contracted a very ſtrict Friendſhip, a Perſon of Quality, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with all the Vertues one could wiſh in a young Man. Happy if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that Treaſure of Innocence! But it
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:33523:124"/>chanc'd by a Misfortune, too frequent to young Perſons, that he fell into wicked Company, which kindled in his Heart the Fire of unchaſt Love: This in a ſhort time conſum'd all his good Inclinations, and caſt him into the incredible Diſorder of a Life full of Sins and Corruptions. His Irregularities were viſible to all the World, and continues in this deprav'd Cuſtom, notwithſtanding the Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Friends: And this Author ſays, that he himſelf frequently exhorted him to return to the Way from which he had departed. As he contemn'd all Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God was reſolv'd in his Perſon to ſhew an Example to young People, who permit themſelves to be blindly carry'd to this miſerable Sin, by a dreadful Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which I ſhall recount to you. Being once aſleep at Midnight, he was ſeis'd with a terrible Fright; wherein being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd, he began to cry out with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful clamour: All the Houſe riſes, and every one comes to his aſſiſtance. They ask him where his Sickneſs held him, but could get no other Anſwer from him than hideous Outcries. They cauſe the Prieſt to be ſent for, who exhorted him to think upon God, and beg pardon of him for his Sins, but in vain. The Prieſt continuing to exhort him with many moving Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Tears, he turns towards him, and looking upon him with ghaſtly Eyes, ſpake thus to him in a lamentable Voice; <hi>Wo be to him that ſeduced me, Wo be to him
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33523:125"/>that ſeduced me. It is in vain to invoke the Grace of God, I ſee Hell open ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</hi>

                     <p>For this reaſon the Fathers have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended it with much care; hearken, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to what they ſhall deliver to you.</p>

                     <p>S. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſays, That the Devil is a creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Serpent; and as to keep a Serpent from entring into a Hole, we hinder it from putting in its Head, which being once
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33523:126"/>enter'd, it cannot be ſtopt from introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing its whole Body. So to hinder the Devil from having admittance into our Soul by Sin, we muſt reſiſt the firſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations; which if not withſtood, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly creeps into the Heart, and makes himſelf Maſter of it.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays, That Impurity is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled in the Soul, like Fire in Straw; and as if one doth not quickly and entirely extinguiſh the Fire, it burns all that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters; ſo if the Flame of Incontinence be not carefully put out, it cauſes a Fire in the Soul, which is often without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>

                     <p>The Reaſon of this Maxim, ſo much recommended by the Saints, is, that it is eaſieſt to reſiſt the Sin of Impurity at the beginning, and very hard to ſurmount it when it is become inveterate and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a long Habit.</p>

                     <p>The Second Cauſe of Impurity is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance in Eating and Drinking,<note place="margin">Second Cauſe.</note> with which it is impoſſible to conſerve Chaſtity in whatſoever Age it be, principally in Youth. The Heat of Blood which boils in that Age, excites them very much to Senſual Pleaſures; but when it is aſſiſted by exterior Cauſes, as Wine and good
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:33523:127"/>Cheer, it produces an incredible diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. Hearken to what S. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſays, who ſpeaks of it by his own Experience.

Theſe are the firſt Arms the Devil makes uſe of againſt Youth. Wine and Youth are a double inflammation to Pleaſure, Why do we caſt Oyl upon the Fire? Why do we add more Fuel to a Body that is on Fire?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>Theotime,</hi> the Advice of this great Saint, ſo experienc'd in the Conduct of Souls, and chiefly of Youth. Apply all your Endeavors to practiſe it exactly, if you will conſerve your Chaſtity; And to exerciſe it well, ſee in Part 4. Chap. 23. of Sobriety.</p>
                     <p>The Third Cauſe you ought carefully to avoid, is wicked Company,<note place="margin">Third Cauſe.</note> and all ſort of diſſolute Diſcourſes, or any ways tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Immodeſty. It is not to be imagin'd
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:33523:128"/>how thoſe things corrupt and deſtroy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity in young People; for how many are there who never fell into this misfortunate Sin, till they had learn'd it, either by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with diſſolute Perſons, or by the occaſion of immodeſt Diſcourſes, which falling upon young Minds, as a Spark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Straw, frequently inflames them with the Fire of unchaſt Love. This Cauſe is ſo ordinary, and ſo pernicious to young People, that it cannot be ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, nor ever enough decry'd. Fly wicked Company, have a care of immodeſt Diſcourſes, or to ſay with the Apoſtle, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not your ſelf to be deceiv'd therewith; for <hi>Wicked Diſcourſes corrupt good Manners.</hi> We have ſpoken of this Cauſe before in Chap. 6. See what is ſaid there, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Example I brought above in Art. 3. of that young Man, who permitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be deprav'd with wicked Company, dy'd in Deſpair.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Cauſe is familiar Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Women,<note place="margin">Fourth Cauſe,</note> which is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly dangerous. It is there, <hi>Theotime,</hi> where the Chaſtity of young Perſons is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruin'd and deſtroy'd; and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after it had been preſerv'd from other Dangers, it there chances to be deplorably Shipwreckt. Impure Love enters but too eaſily into young Minds; but when it is aſſiſted by the preſence of the Object, it is inſlam'd beyond all imagination. For this reaſon the Wiſeman gives us that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Admonition,<note n="*" place="margin">In medio mulierum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li commorari, de veſtimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis enim pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit tinea, &amp; à muliere ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas viri. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 42.</note> 
                        <hi>Continue not amongſt
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:33523:128"/>Women, becauſe from their Converſation ſprings the loſs and deſtruction of Men, as Moths which eat Cloaths are bred in the Garments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if the Company of Women be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prejudicial to young People, it becomes pernicious to them, and abſolutely mortal, when it paſſes to a Familiarity, to a Deſire to pleaſe, and be belov'd, to overmuch Freedom, to Careſſes and Demonſtrations of Friendſhip, and ſuch like Privacies, too common amongſt young Perſons, which S. <hi>Jerom</hi> calls very well, <hi>Principia moriturae virginitatis; The beginning of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruin of Chaſtity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We muſt add to this Cauſe, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt or too curious Looks, which may be perform'd either in, or out of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Love enters by the Eyes; and ſometimes a Look, without any wicked Deſign, draws after it a vaſt train of Sins. Give ear to what the Holy Ghoſt teaches you by the Mouth of the Wiſeman,<note n="*" place="margin">Virginem ne aſpicias, ne forte ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizer is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cora illius.

                     <p>Engrave this deeply in your Memory, and have a care to govern well your Sight, ſo that it be not too diſſolute for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Looks; and if it happen to glance upon dangerous Objects, at leaſt fix it not there, but withdraw it immediately. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame Rule in reſpect of all Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, or immodeſt Figures, which are ſo many Rocks for Chaſtity to ſplit on, and wherewith the World is misfortunately repleniſh'd.</p>

                     <head type="sub">What Temptation is, and of the Means to know whether one hath ſinn'd in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</head>
                     <p>We call Temptation a Propoſal of Sin made to the Soul,<note place="margin">What Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</note> to induce her to commit it, or rather a Thought alluring to Sin.</p>
                     <p>Now the Soul may conſent unto Sin Three manner of ways. 1.<note place="margin">Sin may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to three ways.</note> By actually and voluntarily doing it. 2. In not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but deſiring to perform it. 3. Neither performing nor deſiring, but taking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or delight in the Sin. Or to ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, the Will may conſent unto Sin by the Action, by the Deſire, and by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence or wilful Delectation. From hence ariſe two things which ought to be well taken notice of.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is nothing but Conſent which cauſes the Sin, and by conſequence the Thought alone of a Sin, is not a Sin, as long as the Will doth not conſent in one of thoſe three manners; and altho' the Thought ſhould continue a long time, it is not a Sin without Conſent; but on the contrary, it is meritorious to reject it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To know whether one hath ſinn'd mortally in a Temptation,<note place="margin">An imporiant Remarks</note> it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conſider, whether one hath done a wicked Action, or deſir'd it; but one muſt take notice whether he hath wilfully taken pleaſure in thinking on it: For the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:33523:132"/>voluntary Delectation of a mortal Sin, is a mortal Sin. This muſt be well obſerv'd, becauſe there are many who deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein, and believe they have not conſented to a Temptation, but when they had either done or deſir'd the Evil to which they were tempted.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, one neceſſary thing is here to be obſerv'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are two ſorts of Delight in Temptation; the one which precedes the Conſent, which is that one feels in the beginning of the Temptation, and which draws the Will to Conſent. The other which follows the Conſent, and it is that which the Will takes in the thing propoſed. This Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Delight is a Sin, but not the Firſt.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, to ſee whether you have ſinn'd by the Delectation of an evil Thought, you muſt know whether that Delight were voluntary, that is, whether you gave your Conſent. And becauſe an Action cannot be voluntary, except know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge went before, to judge whether you conſented to that Delectation, you muſt take notice whether you perceiv'd it, and how you behav'd your ſelf after you reflected on it, <hi>viz.</hi> whether you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd to entertain your ſelf therewith or no; for if you have continu'd, it is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and ſo you have ſinn'd. And this Sin was either Mortal or Venial; Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, if you continu'd with a deliberate Will, or by a voluntary and affected Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Venial, if that Continuation was
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:33523:132"/>thro' Inadvertence, and without an entire Conſent, not deſiring really to pleaſe your ſelf therein, and yet alſo not uſing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Endeavors to reject it.</p>

And in theſe two Caſes you have no reaſon to complain but of your ſelf. Without theſe two Cauſes, your Age will alſo furniſh you with ſufficient: The Enemy will not let you reſt, or if he do, it is to ſurpriſe you more eaſily. You muſt therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelf couragiouſly for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and prepare the neceſſary Arms to defend your ſelf in that War.

Look upon your ſelf from Head to Toe, and you will find nothing but what comes from God: Yet you in the midſt of all theſe Favors and all theſe Benefits, go about criminally to offend him, deſpiſing the Goodneſs of ſo liberal a God, the Love of ſo kind a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making uſe of his own Bleſſings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and to offer an Injury to him. Go you ungrateful and degenetate Child, more cruel than Beaſts! Tigers have a love for him that feeds them, and you care not to offend the Author of all the Good you have.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now that you may thus ſtifle Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their birth, remember to perform two things.<note place="margin">Statim ut li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bido titillave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſenſum, aut blandum voluptatis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendium dulci nos calore perfuderit, erumpamus in hanc vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem: Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus auxiliator meus, non ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebo quid fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat mihi ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                        </note> 1. Raiſe your Mind to God, and proteſt unto him, that you renounce the Temptation with all your Heart, and will not conſent unto it: Beg of him the aſſiſtance of his Grace to reſiſt it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge humbly that you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him. It is incredible, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> how powerful Prayer is in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Temptation. 2. After that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your Mind, divert your ſelf by applying your Thought to perform ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as to Labor, to Read, to Speak with ſome one, to take ſome Recreation, or other like thing, which may keep your Mind employ'd, and you will find by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:33523:136"/>that the Temptation oftentimes without trouble will paſs away, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
                     <p>If it continue and be obſtinate to return, perſevere in employing theſe two Means; Pray with more fervor, proteſt that you will not conſent, proceed in entertaining your Mind with ſomething elſe. If you be all alone, it will be good to ſtir up your ſelf by ſome exterior Action of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to raiſe your Eyes or Hands to Heaven, knock your Breaſt, caſt your ſelf on your Knees to demand of God Grace to reſiſt. See the Example of S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> Art. 8. It would alſo do very well to frighten your ſelf with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Death, with the thoughts of Gods Judgments and of Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to that great Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Wiſeman,<note n="*" place="margin">In omnibus operibus tuis memorare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſima, &amp; in aeternum non peccabis. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.40.</note> 
                        <hi>Remember the laſt things, and you ſhall never ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Have a care not to ſtop your Thoughts to look upon the Temptation it ſelf,<note place="margin">An important Advice.</note> but apply your Mind to think upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which may divert you. And for this effect, principally when the Temptation continues a long time, endeavor to make reflection upon one or more of the former Conſiderations, and after you have weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them well, make a ſinal Reſolution ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to conſent thereunto, altho' it ſhould return a thouſand times.</p>
                     <p>Not to content your ſelf to reject a Temptation,<note place="margin">Another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to make uſe of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, as a Motive to ſome vertuous Action.</note> but to take an occaſion from thence to perform ſome Action of Piety, is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:33523:137"/>a moſt effectual Remedy againſt it. For Example, on the Day you have been tempted, apply your ſelf more to Prayer than ordinarily, read ſome pious Book, do ſome Mortification, give ſome Alms to the Poor; and above all, in the time of Temptation exerciſe ſome Act of Vertue, as deteſting of Sin, loving of God with all your Heart, proteſting you will offend him no more. By this means you will defeat your Enemy with his own Arms; and he ſeeing that, inſtead of moving you to Sins by his Temptations, he gives you occaſion to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Vertue, will deſiſt from tempting you, fearing to advance your Salvation by the ſame Means he employ'd to deſtroy you.</p>
                     <p>But above all,<note place="margin">Third Advice, to diſtruſt ones own Forces.</note> 
                        <hi>Theotime,</hi> be careful when you reſiſt a Temptation, not to confide in your own Forces, but to expect all from the ſole Grace of God. This is a chief Means to overcome Temptations, humbly acknowledging that you can do nothing of your ſelf, and that without the ſuccor of Divine Grace you cannot conquer them. By how much more you diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in your own ſtrength, putting your confidence only in God, by ſo much more eaſily will you ſurmount them.<note place="margin">Noli de viri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus tuis prae ſumere.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now the principal Means to obtain many Favors of God in Temptations, is Prayer, and the frequentation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and chiefly Confeſſion, which hath a wonderful force againſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and without it it is morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to reſiſt them any long time.

                     <p>All the force of the Devil in Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conſiſts only in Craft and Deceit; wherefore the beſt Means to reſiſt him, is to know the Tricks he ordinarily makes uſe of.

                     <p>The Firſt is that by which he hinders them from regarding or knowing the Evil which is in the Sin they are going to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;<note place="margin">Firſt Artifice.</note> and on the contrary, he repreſents to their Imagination very livelily, on one ſide the ſweetneſs of the Delight of Sin, which he alway makes them think far greater than it is, and on the other ſide the trouble and difficulty to reſiſt it, and abſtain from it, which makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it inſupportable.</p>
                     <p>Who doth not ſee,<note place="margin">The Falſity of this Artifice.</note> that all theſe Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are great in all theſe three things? For the Evil which is in Sin is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all Evils imaginable, as we have ſaid above, Art. 3. The Delight of Sin is but for a moment, and it is follow'd by Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sadneſs, and Deſpair. The trouble of reſiſtance continues not long, and a ſweet and pleaſing Conſolation follows it; it merits Heaven, and frequently the deliverance from many other Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>O dear <hi>Theotime,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Remedy.</note> permit not your ſelf to be abus'd in this manner by the Enemy of your Salvation: When he ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Temptation to you, caſt an Eye upon the Evil you are going to do, which is a mortal Sin, the greateſt of all Evils. Think not on the Pleaſure that is offer'd, which will paſs like a Shadow, but upon the Sorrow and Diſpleaſure it brings after it. Regard not the Pain and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of reſiſtance, but the Joy, Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Benefit you will receive from
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:33523:138"/>thence. If you act thus, you will find that the Temptation will in a ſmall time va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
                     <p>The Second Deceit by which the Devil ſeduces young People,<note place="margin">Second Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> is to propoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in the Temptation, the eaſineſs of getting Pardon, and perſwade them that they will do Penance, and Confeſs themſelves of it. Alas, <hi>Theotime,</hi> how frequently doth it fall out, and too often, that in the Combat of Temptation, the Conſcience reſiſting on her ſide by the good Motions God gives her, this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Thought comes into the Mind, I will Confeſs my ſelf of it, I will do Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for it: And with this Thought one miſerably reſolves to commit this Sin. What then? If you imagin'd that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Sin would caſt you into the Pit of Hell, you would not attempt to offend him; And becauſe you hope he will pardon you, do not you ſcruple to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him? O what Impiety is this! O Wickedneſs! Will you be Impious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is Good? Do you offend him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will pardon you? What greater Affront can be offer'd to God? O <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> if ever this Thought come into your Mind, reject it as a Blaſphemy, and as a Wile of the Devil, by which he would caſt you into the abyſs of Sin.</p>
                     <p>The Third Deceit of the Devil towards young Perſons is,<note place="margin">Third Artifice.</note> that after he hath made them ſometimes yield to his Temptations by the former Artifices, he puts into their
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:33523:139"/>Mind this falſe and wicked Opinion, That it is impoſſible to reſiſt Temptations, and to abſtain from Sin; to the end that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſs'd with this Perſuaſion, they may make no Endeavors to reſiſt them, and give themſelves over to Evil without any reſtraint.<note place="margin">The falſeneſs of this Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>A deteſtable Perſuaſion! a diabolical Invention! which is ſo much more deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as being moſt falſe and pernicious, it is nevertheleſs moſt common amongſt young People.<note place="margin">O inſenſati Galatae!

This Perſuaſion comes not from him who calls you to him to ſave you, but from the Devil who ſeeks to deſtroy you without recovery.</p>
                     <p>O dear Child,<note place="margin">The Remedies.</note> permit not your ſelf ever to be ſeduced by this execrable Thought, but in the midſt of the moſt violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations call to mind the Mercy of your Saviour, who never abandons thoſe who hope in him.<note n="*" place="margin">Circumde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dique &amp; non erat qui adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varet, memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus ſum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordiae tuae, Domine, &amp; cooperatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis tuae quae à ſa culo ſunt, quoniam eruis ſuſtinentes te, Domine, &amp; liberaſti me de perditione. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.</note>

                     <p>Theſe are the three moſt ordinary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices the Devil makes uſe of againſt young Perſons in their Temptations, and all three are purſu'd in order.

And in fine, when he hath them deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, he makes the Difficulty to abſtain vaſt and prodigious in appearance, that they may not attempt to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it.

                     <p>Heretofore the City of <hi>Bethulia</hi> in <hi>Juda</hi> being Beſieg'd by <hi>Holofernes,</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal People of the Town, with all the Commonalty, betook themſelves to their Prayers, to obtain of God their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: And ſeeing God did not hear them ſo ſoon as they expected, they reſolv'd to deliver themſelves, if Succor did not come in Five Days.

                     <p>We ordinarily commit two Faults after we are deliver'd from a Temptation.<note place="margin">Two Faults af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</note> The Firſt is, We give not Thanks to God for the Victory we have gain'd by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Grace. The Second, We make no preparation to reſiſt the following Temptations. Theſe two Defects are the cauſe why we eaſily relapſe into other Temptations, and are at length overcome by them. The Firſt, becauſe God would have us acknowledge his Favors, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly great ones, ſuch as is that of a Victory over a Temptation. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, becauſe he who doth not ſtand upon his Guard, is ſoon ſurpris'd by his Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is therefore moſt important,<note place="margin">Firſt Remedy.</note> 
                        <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> when you have ſurmounted a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, that you have a care to give God Thanks for it, either ſometime after the Temptation, or at leaſt at the end of the Day in your Evening Prayers. Render him Thanks with all your Heart for this Victory, acknowledge that it comes from him alone, and not from you, and that without him you had a thouſand times been vanquiſh'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Second Remedy.</note> Prepare your ſelf to reſiſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the future. 1. Making a firm Proteſtation to God, to reſiſt them with
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:33523:142"/>all your power. 2. Humbly demanding the continuation of his aſſiſtance. 3. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to make uſe of ſuch and ſuch Means which you know will happily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                     <p>If it chance that you remain ſome time without any Temptation, confide not too much in this Peace and Tranquillity:<note place="margin">Saepe anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas hoſtis, poſtquam menti noſtrae tentationis certamen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flixerit, ab ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuo certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ad rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus recedit, non ut illatae malitiae finem praebeat, ſed ut in corda quae per qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erem ſecura reddiderit, repente redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens facilius inopinatus erumpat. <hi>S. Greg.</hi> 3. <hi>Moral.</hi> 16.</note> For it frequently happens, as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves, that the Enemy permits thoſe whom he hath much tempted, to continue ſome time in quiet, that not having a care, he may ſoon after ſurpriſe them more eaſily, when they think leaſt of him, and that he may make them fall into Sin by a ſudden and violent Temptation. For this reaſon ſtand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon your Guard, demanding daily of God Grace to reſiſt the Aſſaults of Temptations. Be careful to divert quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from your Mind, all the firſt Thoughts that may move you to Sin.</p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:33523:142"/>Example may ſtir up your Courage, and teach you how to manage the Arms with which they have very fortunately over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt many others I might bring, I have choſen out the great S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> whom I would propoſe to you for a Model and Example. He was young as you are, at the time of theſe Temptations; he was more tempted than ever you will be, and perhaps amongſt all the Servants of God, his Youth was moſt try'd by Temptations, and encounter'd them with an admirable Perſeverance. I ſhall give you a Relation of what he himſelf recounts, read it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, and mark well all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>This Saint being yet young, after he had ſpent ſome time in a worldly Life, was mov'd with a Deſire to ſerve God, and labor to effect his Salvation by a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. He takes a Reſolution to leave the World, and to retire into ſome Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to do Penance, and apply himſelf entirely to Vertue. He went firſt to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> to viſit the Holy Places, and from thence he retir'd into the Deſert.</p>
                     <p>He continu'd in that Place four whole Years, during which time, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the incredible Auſterities he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, he was toſſed with continual Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and ſo great, that they move Compaſſion in thoſe who read them.

In this State, and in this Priſon, to which I had condemn'd my ſelf to avoid that of Hell, altho' I had no other Company but that of Scorpions and ſavage Beaſts; I found my ſelf often in Imagination with the Roman Dames.

                  <head type="sub">Particular Obſtacles to rich young Perſons.</head>
                  <p>THE Obſtacles we have ſpoken of hitherto, are common to all young People, of whatſoever Quality or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But becauſe amongſt the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there are ſome which bring with them particular Impediments, it is proper to treat briefly of them. Theſe Conditions are chiefly Riches, Nobility, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
                  <p>As for Riches, there is no queſtion but they cauſe a particular Obſtacle to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſince the Son of God himſelf aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us as much,<note place="margin">Quod autem in ſpinas ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, hi ſunt qui audierunt, &amp; à ſollicitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus &amp; divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis, &amp; volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptatibus vitae euntes ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur &amp; non reſerunt fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum. <hi>Iuc.</hi> 8.</note> ſaying they choke the Seed of the Word of God in Souls, and hinder it from taking root, and bringing forth Fruit; which is true, not only in Men already advanc'd in Age, in whom Covetouſneſs, and the love of Riches, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bears Dominion, but alſo in young Men, to whom the poſſeſſion of Riches is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Hindrance of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>This is known ſufficiently by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which manifeſts, that rich young People are ordinarily more vicious than others. We ſee them addicted to their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſlothful, and Enemies to Labor, their Minds always taken up with Vanity, aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after Greatneſs, Fortune, and the Riches of the World, Proud, Preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, deſpiſing all the World, Untractable,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:33523:145"/>and reſiſting the moſt wholſom Inſtruction and Advices, ſubject to a vaſt number of Sins, oftentimes malicious and ingenious to effect it.<note place="margin">Melior eſt pauper ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate ſua, quam dives in pravis itineri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.

                  <p>I ſay this, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to the end I may admoniſh you, that if God hath order'd you to be born in a good and rich Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you take a care that your Riches ſerve not for your Damnation, as they do daily to many like you;<note place="margin">Quam diffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce qui pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as habent in regnum Dei intrabunt? <hi>Lucae</hi> 18.</note> the multitude whereof makes but too evident that Truth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by the Mouth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who ſays, <hi>How difficult is it for the Rich to be ſaved?</hi> Wherefore you have need to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Three things.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Particular Obſtacles to Noble Perſons.</head>
                  <p>TO put Nobility amongſt the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles of Vertue, were to offer an Injury to it; but we ſhall do no wrong to Truth, if we ſay that the ill uſe which Perſons in Dignity make of it, is a great Impediment to their Salvation, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the cauſe of their Ruin and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>To ſee this Truth, and clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there is no State ordinarily more corrupt, nor fill'd with Vice, than that of the Nobility, we need only make a little Reflection upon the Life of Great Men.</p>
                  <p>We ſee a prodigious Pride reign in them, which makes them contemn all the World, and eſteem all others infinitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. Ambition, and a deſire of growing Great, perpetually poſſeſſes them. They are extravagantly addicted to all their Pleaſures, Lovers of Delights, Bold and Shameleſs to publiſh their Sins, and glory in them, Envious in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Ty'd to their Intereſt, Affecting none but themſelves, Unjuſt, Violent, Harſh, and often Cruel towards others, eſpecially their Inferiors, Impatient and Cholerick, Given to Swearing and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, Revengeful even to exceſs, not being able to ſuffer or diſſemble the leaſt
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:33523:147"/>Injury, which frequently is grounded only in their Imagination, and even make open profeſſion never to endure or diſſemble any. O God! what a Life is this for Men who make profeſſion of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion!</p>
                  <p>And that which accompliſhes the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of this Condition is,<note place="margin">The deteſtable Paſſion for Duels.</note> that deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Paſſion for Duels, with which they are ſo continually poſſeſt, that there is ſcarce a moment in their Life, wherein they have not a Reſolution to expoſe themſelves to Fight upon the firſt Injury, or at leaſt at the firſt Challenge; A Reſolution which keeps them in a continual mortal Sin, and hinders them from ever being in the Grace of God. Not to mention the Contempt of Religion, Senſuality and Impiety, which uſually reign in that State, and eſpecially now adays, where there are found ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who ſay unto God,<note place="margin">Qui dixerunt Deo recede a nobis, ſcient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am viarum tuarum nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.

Who is the all-powerful, who ſays that we muſt ſerve him? What doth it profit us to Pray unto him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this a thing much to be deplor'd, to ſee in the midſt of Chriſtianity, the faireſt part of Chriſtian States to be moſt corrupted? And that Nobility which is given as a Recompence of Vertue, and to excite others thereto, ſhould become the Source of Vice, and the Fountain of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:33523:148"/>Corruption of Noble Perſons: So that it is a Mark of Reprobation to many; and it were more deſirable for the greateſt part of Noble-men that they had never been born. For what advantage is it to be Great before Men, and to be wretched and contemptible in the ſight of God?<note n="a" place="margin">Quid prodeſt quod liber eſt in natura, qui ſervus eſt in conſcientia? <hi>Euſeb.

                  <p>O my dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> if you be Noble, I beſeech you to make here a ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon your ſelf, and upon the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger your Nobility expoſes your Salvation to. Diſtruſt your State, and be afraid leſt it ſhould ruin you. By how much more you are rais'd in Condition, by ſo much more have you an Obligation to Vertue, and are in greater hazard of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.<note place="margin">Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> Labor earneſtly for your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and uſe all poſſible diligence that your Nobility be not a cauſe of you Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as it is to many. For this Effect, practiſe the following Advices.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Firſt Advice.</note> Underſtand perfectly what true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:33523:148"/>is. Nobility is inſeparable from Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it takes its origin from thence, and is only conſerv'd by it. It hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon your Anceſtors, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their worthy Actions; if you imitate them in their Vertue, you will me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Title of Noble; if you imitate them not, you have but a falſe and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Nobility.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Know,<note place="margin">Second Advice.</note> that beſides this Nobility In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Men, there is a Divine Nobility infinitely rais'd above this, which is that which is acquir'd by Grace.<note place="margin">Videte qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem dedit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Pater ut filii Dei nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemur &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. Intellige tibi eſſe genus de coelo. &amp; age vivendo: ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto reſponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as patri; Dei ſilium ut ſe probat, qui vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuratur humanis, qui divinis virtutibus eluceſcit. <hi>Chryſolog. Serm.</hi> 6, 7.</note> For if No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility conſiſts in being born of Illuſtrious Parents, and of thoſe that are conſiderable in the World, what Nobility will it be to be made the Child of God, Coheir of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> predeſtinated to poſſeſs the the Kingdom of Heaven? This, <hi>Theotime,</hi> is the great, the prime and the true Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; if you poſſeſs this, you are really No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and if you have it not, how Noble ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may be before Men, you are moſt Infamous and Abominable in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This being ſo,<note place="margin">Third Advice.</note> permit not your ſelf to be puft up with Pride and Arrogancy for your Nobility.<note place="margin">Mala nobilitas quae ſe per ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbiam apud Deum reddit ignobilem. <hi>Aug. Serm.</hi> 27.</note> 
                     <hi>That is a wicked Nobility</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) <hi>which makes you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the ſight of God by its Pride.</hi> On the contrary, by ſo much more Humble, as you are more Noble, according to the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:33523:149"/>Precept of the Wiſeman;<note n="a" place="margin">Quanto magnus es hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia te in omnibus, &amp; apud Deum invenies gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>By how much greater you are,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by ſo much humble your ſelf more in all things; and by this means you will render your ſelf agreeable to God.</hi> It is an excellent Advice, like that which S. <hi>Jerom</hi> gives to Noblemen;<note n="b" place="margin">Nulli te un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam de ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate praepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, nec inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riores quaſque aut humili lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co natas te in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriores pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.

Jerom. Epiſt. ad Celant.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Prefer not your ſelf before others by reaſon of your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and contemn not thoſe who are not Noble. Our Religion hath no reſpect to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it regards not the Condition of Men, but their Minds; it judgeth of Nobility by their Manners. There is no Nobility in the ſight of God, but not to ſerve Sin. The height of Nobility is to be Illuſtrious in Vertues.</hi> O what an excellent and neceſſary Advice is this for Noblemen!</p>
                  <p n="4">4.<note place="margin">Fourth Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> Endeavor to obſerve well the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Vices of the Nobility, that you may carefully avoid them; we have hinted at ſome of them, you will here alſo find others; have a care to encounter them in good time, that you may ſhun them, and clear your ſelf from them, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily of God for this effect the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Grace.<note place="margin">Exiguo enim conceditur miſericordia, potentes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem potenter tormenta pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientur. <hi>Sap.</hi> 6.</note> Remember that the Juſtice of God will be ſevere towards the Great and Noble, and their Sins will be puniſh'd more rigorouſly than thoſe of others, as it is ſaid in the Book of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5.<note place="margin">Fifth Advice.</note> Make your Nobility advance Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. You will ſay, How can this be? See
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:33523:149"/>how. If being Noble you be Vertuous,<note place="margin">Minimè qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Deus eſt acceptor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonarum, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcio tamen quo pacto vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in nobili plus placet. <hi>S. Bern. Epiſt. ad Sophi.</hi>
                     </note> firſt your Vertue will be in ſome manner more agreeable to God, according to the Judgment of St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> Beſides, your Example will move others to Vertue, your Diſcourſe will have more authority to perſuade them to Good; They will give credit to you, when you mildly reprehend their Faults. You will have Means to comfort the Afflicted, Credit to relieve the Oppreſſed; You may often take up Quarrels, and reconcile Enemies. Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe your ſelf in all theſe things, and God will give a Bleſſing to your Nobility, and you will be Noble both before God and Men.</p>
                  <p>See yet many things which concern Nobility in Part 5. Chap. 11. Article 1.3. &amp; 4.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Particular Obſtacles of young Incumbents, or ſuch as have Benefices without Cure.</head>
                  <p>I Shall not Diſcourſe to you here of all the Obſtacles which Benefices may bring to the Salvation of Incumbents, but only of thoſe you may meet with during your Youth, reſerving to ſpeak of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at the End of this Work. Here I ſhall only take notice of Four amongſt others.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt conſiſts in this,<note place="margin">Firſt Obſtacle.</note> That being an Incumbent from your Youth, the Benefice
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:33523:150"/>deſigns you to an Eccleſiaſtical State, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you be capable to make choice of it, and perhaps you are not fit for it, nor call'd by God; and perhaps, as it often happens, you have an averſion and repugnance to it. This Obſtacle is of great Conſequence, and deſerves to be well conſider'd; For thoſe who enter thus into an Eccleſiaſtical State, put themſelves in danger of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting great Faults therein, and of never obtaining their Salvation; becauſe that State bringing with it vaſt Obligations, and requiring a greater Stock of Vertues and Perfections than others, requires a more advis'd Deliberation, and chiefly a Vocation from God. I ſhall appoint a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for this Obſtacle hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The Second Obſtacle ſprings from the more particular Obligation which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice brings of living holily.<note place="margin">Second Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> All Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are oblig'd to Vertue, but the Clergy and Incumbents by reaſon of the Sanctity of their State, have a ſtricter Obligation to it. This Obligation renders their Sins more heinous, and them more criminal in the ſight of God, and is the cauſe that, when they are vicious, they draw upon their Heads the Divine Anger, and his forſaking them: From whence it happens, that they become more wicked than others, more obſtinate in Vice, and more incapable of Correction and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Third Obſtacle.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third Obſtacle comes from the Obligation they have to recite the Divine
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:33523:150"/>Office, of which young Incumbents diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves very badly, altho' they be oblig'd to it under mortal Sin, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to ſay it, are oblig'd to the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Fruits of their Benefice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the Days they have omitted it. This Impediment of the Salvation of Incumbents is very great: For the contempt of their Duty, and theſe mortal Sins thus neglected and repeated, rendring them more unworthy of the Grace of God, are the Cauſes why they fall into many other Sins, and into extream Diſorders, as we daily ſee.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Obſtacle ariſes from the Obligation they have of exterior Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,<note place="margin">Fourth Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> and an Eccleſiaſtical Habit; becauſe, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſays admirably well,<note place="margin">Etſi habitus non faciat Monachum, oportet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Clericos veſtes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes ordini ſemper deferre; Ut per decentiam habitus extrinſeci morum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtatem intrinſecam oſtendant. <hi>Conc. Trid. Seſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Altho' the Habit makes not a Monk, yet nevertheleſs the Clergy ought always to wear a Habit conformable to their State, that by the modeſty of their exterior Habit, they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the interior Goodneſs of their Manners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now adays Incumbents, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly young ones, know nothing of this Obligation: For we ſee them Cloath'd like others,<note place="margin">Abuſes of this Obligation.</note> always in ſhort Garments, ſometimes in undecent Colours, cover'd with Laces and other worldly Ornaments, like Lay-men; in long Hair, and often Curl'd and Powder'd, like Courtiers. This is an intolerable Abuſe, which cauſes many
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:33523:151"/>Diſorders amongſt Incumbents, who not being diſtinguiſh'd from the Laity in their Habit, do not believe their Duty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Life and Manners. It is a Diſobedience to the Church, which in all her Councils complains of this Diſorder, and commands Incumbents to wear an Eccleſiaſtical Habit. It is a Contempt of Religion, and of the Eccleſiaſtical State, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> calls it. It is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Injuſtice; for is it not an unjuſt Action, to deſire to live on the Patrimony of the Church, and not be content to bear her Mark?</p>
                  <p>Let every one take care of this that will, but Incumbents who live thus, and will not change, are not in the State of Grace, neither can they receive Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they have not a full purpoſe to wear an Eccleſiaſtical Habit. Now, if not they but their Parents enjoy it, as it often happens, they are oblig'd to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them; and the Parents are not in a good State of Conſcience, but ſin grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, if they hinder them from wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Habit agreeable to their State.</p>
                  <p>For the remedy of theſe Obſtacles, ſee what you are to do.</p>
                  <p>As for the Firſt,<note place="margin">Firſt Remedy.</note> conſider whether you have a repugnance to an Eccleſiaſtical Life, and whether you be not determin'd to undertake that State; for in that caſe you cannot with a ſafe Conſcience keep your Benefice, you are oblig'd to quit it, and advertiſe your Parents, or thoſe on
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:33523:151"/>whom you depend, that you have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of being an Eccleſiaſtic. If you be only unreſolv'd, not having as yet an abſolute Will to be or not to be of that Condition, you ſhould endeavor to reſolve the ſooneſt you can.</p>
                  <p>Now if you have no repugnance, but rather an Inclination to an Eccleſiaſtical Life, think not that your Benefice ought to be a ſufficient Mark of your Vocation; for perhaps you are not fit for it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never deſiſt from begging daily of God, to know the State which is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for his Service, and your own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and performing all that, you ought to make a good Choice of your Condition, as we ſhall ſhew you hereafter.</p>
                  <p>For a remedy of the three other Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,<note place="margin">Remedy for the three other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles.</note> labor to acquit your ſelf of three Obligations of your Benefice which I even now hinted to you: Live Vertuouſly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to render your Youth pleaſing to God; Recite your Office exactly, and devoutly; Be Cloth'd like an Incumbent, that is, not being in Holy Orders, in a black Habit, without Ornaments; your Hair very modeſt, wear a long Garment as much as you can upon Sundays and Feaſts, and always when you partake of the Sacraments of Confeſſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                  <p>If you do thus, <hi>Theotime,</hi> it will befall you as it did the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was Dedicated by his Parents in his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

All their Care aims at find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Benefices, and ſometimes by ill and dangerous Ways, at advancing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, receiving and diſpoſing of it as they pleaſe, againſt the Intention of the Founders, and of the Church her ſelf; making their Children learn a little Latin, neglecting in the mean time all the reſt which is moſt neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> the Care of making their Children acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Obligations of their State, ſay their Office, wear an Eccleſiaſtical Habit, live conformable to their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and of cauſing them to be bred up in an Eccleſiaſtical Spirit, and inſtructed in the knowledge of their Duty. O wicked Parents! who for a little Temporal Wealth, charge themſelves with all the Sins of their Children, and with their Children engage themſelves in an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Damnation. And yet more misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate the Uncles and other Relations of Incumbents, who have no leſs diſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affection for their Nephews and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, whom they blindly charge with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, and themſelves with all the Ill they cauſe in the Church, as we daily ſee.

                     </note> This was a Diſorder which St. <hi>Bernard</hi> deplor'd in his Time, whoſe Words I ſhall put in the Margin.</p>
                  <p>The Remedy of this Evil is in the Hands of the Parents themſelves; it belongs to them to moderate that great Greedineſs they have for Benefices, to make more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Salvation of their Children, than of their Temporal Poſſeſſions, and prefer the Quiet of their Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Advancement of their Families, which Benefices inſtead of raiſing, as they think, frequently ruin.</p>
                  <p>For this effect they ought to have a care, not to beſtow Benefices upon their Children, without having ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd their Spirit, their Inclinations, and the Diſpoſitions they have to an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Calling; And that they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it with more certainty, they ſhould not be Judges thereof themſelves, but make the Inclinations of their Children be Examin'd by able Perſons, to whom the Children may freely declare their repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, if they have any, to that Dignity, as it frequently happens, who might judge religiouſly of their Diſpoſitions for the ſame State, without Intereſt, without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:33523:153"/>and declare ſincerely to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Judgment they make of them, whether they think the Children fit for an Eccleſiaſtical Calling, as much as they may gueſs in that Age. The Fathers may follow their Judgment with the enſuing Precautions, <hi>viz.</hi> To take a great care of the Education of the Children they deſign for the Church; Make them be brought up in the Fear of God, in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Spirit, in the Knowledge of their State and its Obligations, and not in the Vanity and Spirit of the World, as they often do. For this end commit them to Perſons of Piety, of Prudence, of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who have the Zeal of an Eccleſiaſtical Spirit. Have a care that they acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Obligation of their Office; That they wear the Habit of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at leaſt as we have ſaid in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapter; That they live holily, as Children deſtin'd to the Church; Diſpoſe well of the Revenues of the Benefices, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying it to diſcharge their Duty in an honeſt and moderate Maintenance of an Incumbent, and the reſt in pious Works. And in fine, they ought to obſerve the Manners and Inclinations of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, informing themſelves by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to whom they are committed, and whether they know they be inclin'd to an Eccleſiaſtical State, or have not convenient Diſpoſitions for it; for then they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to diſpoſe of their Children in ſome other Employ.</p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:33523:154"/>
                  <p>If they do otherwiſe than what we have ſaid, they render themſelves culpable of a vaſt number of Sins which their Children commit in an Eccleſiaſtical Calling, which is a horrible thing to reflect on; and for the Temporal Goods they have too much affected, they will incur their Eternal Damnation, and that of their Children. Now to the end they may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of their Obligation concerning this Subject, let them take the pains to read the former Chapter, and alſo Chap. 9. of Part 5.</p>

                  <p>BEing that all Chriſtian Piety, both in Great and Small, conſiſts in imitating our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I would firſt of all propoſe here that Divine Pattern, to give you a perfect Model of the Vertues you ought to acquire, and by which you ought to form your Youth.</p>
                  <p>It was for this Reaſon, according to the Obſervation of one of the Fathers of the Church, why this Divine Maſter being come to Teach and Save all Men, was pleas'd to paſs thro' all the Ages of Man, even to a perfect Age, to ſanctifie them all, and by making himſelf like unto them, more eaſily invite to his Imitation.</p>

                     <hi>For this Reaſon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he made himſelf a Child to Children, that he might ſanctifie them. He made himſelf a Little-one to Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le-ones, giving Holineſs to thoſe of that Age, to the end he might afford them in his Perſon an Example of Piety and Sanctity, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. He made himſelf a young Man to young Men, giving them a Pattern, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying them for the Service of our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:33523:155"/>
                  <p>It is by this Divine Pattern of Youth, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> that you muſt form yours, and regulate your Actions. It is from him that you muſt learn the Vertues you ought to practiſe in that Age,<note n="*" place="margin">Inſpice &amp; fac ſecundum exemplar quod tibi in monte mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratum eſt. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Look, and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Example which is ſhew'd you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we find Four things in the Goſpel which the Son of God did during the Youth of his mortal Life.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is his hidden Life which he was pleas'd to lead all that time, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting himſelf to Men, but only to his moſt bleſſed Mother and S. <hi>Joſeph;</hi> to teach young People to fly Vanity, ſo natural to their Age, and alſo hurtful, and not to ſeek after the Eſteem of the World by a vain oſtentation of their Parts or Vertues; but only to pleaſe God, and content their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Maſters, by a ſolid Progreſs in Vertue and Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>The Second is the Example of Piety and Religion he was pleas'd to give, by going to the Temple at ſolemn Feaſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Command of the Law, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he was not oblig'd to it; being there, he hearkned to the Doctors, and asked them Queſtions, as if he would learn of them, he who was Maſter of the Doctors and of the Law it ſelf. An admirable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by which he would ſhew to young People the Affection they ought to have for Piety, and that their firſt Care muſt be to ſerve God and labor for their Salvation, addicting themſelves to Acts of Religion, to Prayer, to aſſiſt at the Divine Sacrifice,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:33523:156"/>to the Sacraments, to the Word of God, and to ſeek Inſtruction from the Mouth of the Wiſe, and from thoſe whom God hath given them for their Conduct.</p>
                  <p>The Third thing is that ſo admirable Obedience he ſhew'd to his Parents, which the Goſpel declares in theſe Terms;<note n="a" place="margin">Et deſcendit cum eis &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit Nazareth &amp; erat ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus illis. <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.42.</note> 
                     <hi>He return'd with them unto Nazareth, and was ſubject to them.</hi> An Example which ought to confound all young People, who have ordinarily ſo great a repugnance to Submiſſion. What a ſhame is this for you, <hi>Theotime,</hi> when you are wanting to the great Reſpect you owe to them from whom you receive your Life and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, having before your Eyes the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God,<note n="b" place="margin">Deus erat ſub <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Fourth thing that the Goſpel teaches us of the Youth of our Lord is,<note n="c" place="margin">Jeſus profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciebat ſapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia &amp; aetate &amp; gratia apud Deum &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>according to the meaſure he advanc'd in Age, he viſibly increas'd in Wiſdom and Grace before God and Men;</hi> which is not to be underſtood of an interior increaſe of theſe two Perfections in the Soul of the Son of God; becauſe from the moment of his Conception he was accompliſh'd with them in a perfect fullneſs. But this is to be
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:33523:156"/>underſtood as to the Effects he made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Divine Actions from Day to Day. As the Sun, which altho' he be as much adorn'd with Light at his Riſing as at Mid-day, is ſaid to become more light according to the degrees he riſes, becauſe his Light appears with more brightneſs to our Eyes. But the Goſpel hath made this Obſervation, to give to Chriſtian young Perſons the moſt important Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great care they ought to have to employ their Years to increaſe in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Vertue, and to avoid that ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal a Fault of the greateſt part, who ſeem to advance in Age to no other end than to diminiſh in Innocence. It is a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune infinitely to be deplor'd, to ſee that Children ſhould be corrupted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure that they grow in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that their Age ſhould ſerve them for nothing elſe but to learn Vice, Lying, Impurity, Pride, Diſobedience, Diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> takes notice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.<note place="margin">Jam mortua erat adole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentia mea mala &amp; nefan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, &amp; ibam in juventutem quanto aetate major, tanto vanitate tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pior. <hi>S.

                     <hi>The Fear of God is the beginning of Wiſdom.</hi> And the ſame Scripture, in the Hiſtory of holy <hi>Tobias,</hi> obſerves expreſly, that being a Child,<note n="b" place="margin">Genuit ex ea filium quem ab infantia ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere Deum docuit, &amp; abſtinere ab omni peccato. <hi>Tob.</hi> 1.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now by this Fear we muſt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a groſs and ſervil Fear, that regards nothing but the Puniſhment and Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which it apprehends more than the Offence;<note place="margin">What this Fear is.</note> but a reſpectful Fear, by which conſidering the Greatneſs, and Majeſty of God, his Sanctity, his Power, his Juſtice, we conceive a profound Reſpect, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

                  <p>IF the Greatneſs of God oblige us to fear and honor him with a profound Reſpect,<note place="margin">The Love of God ought to be joyn'd with Fear.</note> his Goodneſs engages us as much to love him. We muſt fear God by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Greatneſs, which renders him infinitely Adorable; and we muſt love him becauſe of his Goodneſs, which makes him infinitely Amiable; we muſt not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate theſe two things, Fear and Love.<note n="a" place="margin">Timor Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini initium dilectionis.</note> 
                     <hi>The Fear of God is the beginning of Love,</hi> as the Holy Scripture ſays, and Love is the perfection of Fear.<note n="b" place="margin">Qui ſine ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more eſt non poterit juſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficari. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 25. Qui non dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git manet in morte. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>He who is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fear cannot be juſtifi'd, and he who Loves not, remains in Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt then love God, dear <hi>Thotime;</hi> for how can it be that we ſhould not love Goodneſs it ſelf, and him who hath lov'd you firſt?<note place="margin">We muſt begin betimes to love God.</note> But you muſt love him betimes, and from your tender Years; you muſt begin that quickly which you muſt do all
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:33523:158"/>your Life, and during all Eternity. The Love of God is our Sovereign Happineſs and laſt End.<note place="margin">We are created for that End;</note> God hath plac'd you in this World on no other Deſign than to love him, and that coming to know him for your Creator, you ſhould render that which a Work ows to its Workman, a Creature to its Creator, a Child to his Father, that is, Love.<note place="margin">And oblig'd thereto.</note> And to oblige you the better thereunto, he hath added all imaginable Favors, having deſign'd you for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his Kingdom in Heaven, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd you when you were loſt, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd you by the Death of his only Son, Call'd you to the Grace of Chriſtianity, Illuminated you with the Light of Faith, Sanctifi'd you by his Grace, Receiv'd you often into his Mercy after you had grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offended him, and a thouſand other Bleſſings hath be beſtow'd upon you. O <hi>Theotime,</hi> how is it poſſible not to love a God who hath lov'd you ſo much!</p>
                  <p>Now there are two things in God for which he ought to be belov'd.<note place="margin">Two Motives of the Love of God.</note> The one is his Goodneſs, which he manifeſts unto us by all the Favors and Bleſſings he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon us. The other is the Goodneſs he poſſeſſes in himſelf, which makes him Sovereignly Amiable. For, if we might ſuppoſe a thing impoſſible, <hi>viz.</hi> That God had never ſhew'd us any Favor, yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be infinitely belov'd, by reaſon of the Sovereign Goodneſs, and infinite Perfections he enjoys in himſelf, which render him infinitely Amiable. Now when
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:33523:159"/>I ſay we muſt love God, I ſpeak of both theſe two Loves, and I mean, that we muſt love him for the Benefits he hath beſtow'd upon us, and not only for them, but alſo in conſideration of his infinite Goodneſs, which renders him ſo lovely, that in the love of his Goodneſs conſiſts the Eternal Happineſs of both Men and Angels.</p>
                  <p>But take notice,<note place="margin">The eſſential Condition of the Love of God.</note> 
                     <hi>Theotime,</hi> that the Love of God to be real, ought to have one very particular Condition, which occurs not in any other Love: For it doth not ſuffice to love God as we love Creatures, but we muſt love him above all things, that is, more than all Creatures.<note n="*" place="margin">Diliges Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, ex tota anima tua, ex omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus viribus tuis &amp; ex om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni mente tua. <hi>Luc.</hi> 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> that is, more than all other things; ſo that you love nothing above him, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater or more amiable than he; nor nothing equal to him, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which can match him.</p>
                  <p>And to ſpeak briefly, the Love of God conſiſts in preferring God before all things;<note place="margin">Wherein the Love of God conſiſts.</note> before the Goods of the World, Pleaſures, Honor, Friends, and Life it ſelf; ſo that you muſt be prepar'd never to love theſe things to the prejudice of the Love you owe to God; and be reſolv'd rather to loſe them a thouſand times, than to be wanting to the Obedience you are oblig'd to render unto him. It is in this preference of God before all things, wherein the eſſential Point of the Love of God conſiſts; a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference without which it is impoſſible to love God, nor by conſequence, to be in the State of Salvation.</p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:33523:159"/>
                  <p>O dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> you muſt then labor to acquire this ſo amiable a Love, and this ſo neceſſary a Preference, to engrave it deeply in your Heart: And to the end you be not deceiv'd therein, by taking, as very many do, apparent Love for the real.<note place="margin">The Practice of the love of God.</note> See the principal Acts you muſt practiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by which you may know whether you love God truly, or no.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Have a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for Sin.</note> Above all things fear and have a horror of Sin, becauſe it is diſpleaſing to God, and infinitely oppoſite to his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and be reſolv'd never to commit a Sin upon any account whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Labor to get Vertue.</note> Labor to acquire the Vertues ſo neceſſary for you, and which he exacts from you. It is the property of Love, to deſire to pleaſe him whom one loves.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">

                  <p>For to contemn a thing ſo holy, which Nature her ſelf inſpires you with, &amp; which God hath ſo ſtrictly commanded you, is not to have the Fear of God.

                  <p>Add to theſe Threats the rigorous Law God had eſtabliſh'd in the old Teſtament againſt wicked Children.<note place="margin">The Severity of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I ſhall cite it all entire, that you may read it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If it happen,</hi> ſays the Law, <hi>that a Father hath a rebellious and diſobedient Child, who will not ſubmit himſelf to the Commands of his Father and Mother, and they have chaſtis'd him, and he would not obey, then ſhall his Father and his Mother take him, and bring him where they keep Judgment, and there they ſhall make their Complaints in this manner: This our Son is ſtubborn and diſobedient, and will not obey our Admonition, and ſeeks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Debauches</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Lapidibus obruet eum omnis popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus civitatis &amp; morietur, ut auferatis maium de medio veſtri, univerſus Iſrael audiens pertimeſcat. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Then,</hi> adds the Law, <hi>he ſhall be ſtoned of the People of the

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the ſevere Law God had Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd againſt rebellious Children. And altho' it was not made in the Evangelical Law, yet they ought no leſs to fear his Choler and Vengeance, whereof but too many Effects daily appear, by the viſible Puniſhment he ſends ſooner or later to Children who fail in ſo holy and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Duty. This Sin is one of thoſe which God ordinarily puniſhes in this Life; and there are ſcarce any wicked Children to whom ſome Puniſhment of God doth not befall in this Life, which is often the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of an Eternal Chaſtiſement.</p>
                  <p>But let us leave theſe Motives of terror and fear, to ſtubborn and obſtinate Spirits, who are not mov'd to their Duty by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Love; as for you, <hi>Theotime,</hi> who have a Deſign to ſerve God with all your Heart, theſe Menaces are not neceſſary; and to perſwade you to render to your Parents all the Reſpect you owe them, it ſuffices to tell you, that that is reaſonable which God deſires. Theſe are the two Motives by which the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd Children of this great Obligation.<note n="a" place="margin">Filii, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite parenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus veſtris in Domino, hoc enim juſtum eſt.

                     <hi>Children, obey your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in all things, becauſe it pleaſeth God.</hi> Render then to your Parents, <hi>Theotime,</hi> the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:33523:161"/>Honor you owe them, conſidering 1. That it is juſt and reaſonable; 2. That God will have it ſo: God, I ſay, whoſe Will ought to be the Rule of our Actions, and whoſe good Pleaſure is the moſt powerful Motive to a generous Soul.</p>
                  <p>Now the Honor you ought to give to your Parents comprehends Four princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal things, which you owe them, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:33523:162"/>them becauſe God commands it, and as he commands it, that is, in ſuch a manner that you love principally their Spiritual Good and Salvation, and endeavor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it by your Prayers, and all other Means which lies in your power.</p>

A tractable Mind is capable of all Good, as an untractable Mind is ſubject to all Wickedneſs. We have ſpoken ſufficiently of this Vertue, and the oppoſite Vice, in Part 1. Chap. 3.

It is a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue neceſſary for Youth, a Fundamental Vertue, and without which one can never arrive at any ſolid Piety, which made the Wiſeman ſay,<note place="margin">Mens juſti me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditabitur obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiam. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.28.</note> that <hi>The Mind of the Juſt will meditate Obedience,</hi> becauſe it is a moſt neceſſary and effectual Means to acquire Vertue, to which it aſpires.</p>
                  <p>It is not only neceſſary for Youth, but alſo ſo convenient for that Age, that it is always proper, and as it were natural. A diſobedient Child is a Species of a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: And an ancient Author numbring up the Diſorders which are found in the World,<note place="margin">St. Cyprian.</note> puts in the third rank, <hi>a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Child,</hi> which he ſays is a Diſorder which brings many others after it.</p>

                  <p>I ſay, obey humbly and willingly, becauſe it is not enough to obey, but you muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey well: A conſtrain'd Obedience, yielded
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:33523:164"/>unwillingly by fear or force, is a ſlaviſh Obedience, which hath no Merit, nor any ſhadow of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>True Obedience proceeds from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of ones Duty, and a deſire to pleaſe God in performing it well. The Firſt makes it humble, the Second makes it voluntary, prompt, and facil.</p>
                  <p>You muſt obey thus, if you deſire your Obedience ſhould be vertuous and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God. And by obeying thus, you learn in good time not to do your own proper Will, but that of others. Proper Will, which is ordinarily the cauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Men, and chiefly of young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is an ill Guide, which leads them into Precipices, and makes them fall into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Misfortunes.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ruffin</hi> recounts to this purpoſe, that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> being yet young, had a Viſion of two Ladies, who appear'd to him endow'd with excellent Beauties; and as the chaſt young Man had a trouble to behold them, they ſaid to him, <hi>Young Man, let not our Preſence afflict you, we are

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Theotime,</hi> Chaſtity is inſeparable from Wiſdom, and it attracts the Divine Grace and Benediction upon young Souls that addict themſelves to it.</p>

Now as to the Practice of this Vertue, remember that it may be violated many ways, by Thoughts, by Words, by Deſires, and by diſhoneſt Actions; And to be Chaſt, you muſt be ſo not only in Actions, but in Thoughts, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and Words, and in all that may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little wound Purity.</p>

                  <p>AS Trees in producing their Fruits, produce at the ſame time Leaves to preſerve them againſt the Injuries of the Air; So Charity placing Chaſtity in a Soul, brings forth alſo Shamefac'dneſs there, to preſerve it from any thing that may hurt it. It is impoſſible to have Chaſtity without Shamefac'dneſs, and Shamefac'dneſs ſerves very much, and is
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:33523:166"/>moſt neceſſary for the conſervation of Chaſtity.</p>

Shamefac'dneſs then is a Vertue which ſets all theſe things at a diſtance from it, and which cannot permit them neither in it ſelf nor others, without bluſhing at them. Now this Vertue agrees particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with Youth.</p>
                  <p>For as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> obſerves very well, altho' we ought to labor in every Age for this Vertue, which is the Ornament of all Ages, yet it appears with much more ſplendor in Youth.<note place="margin">Quid amabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius verecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do adoleſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te? quàm pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chra haec, &amp; quam ſplendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da gemma morum in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta &amp; vultu a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doleſcentis?

There is no more apparent Mark of a Dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Simplicity, nor a more evident Teſtimony of a pure Innocence. It is the Lamp of a chaſt Soul, which ſhines continually to hinder that nothing foul or indecent enter into the Mind, which it doth not immediately diſcover. And thus it baniſhes Sin from the Soul, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:33523:167"/>Purity.

                  <p>The Vice oppoſite to this Vertue is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and Shameleſsneſs, which bluſhes at nothing. It is a Vice as much odious in young Men, as Shamefac'dneſs is amiable.

                  <p>This Vertue is ſingularly deſirable in a young Man,<note place="margin">The Mark of a wiſe and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Mind.</note> becauſe it is a certain Mark of an interior Vertue, and of a wiſe Mind, and proper for Piety.

                  <p n="2">2. In good or indifferent Diſcourſes be not too ready or light in ſpeaking, but hearken before you ſpeak. There are ſome Humors which are always the firſt in Talking, and the laſt in holding their Tongues; who meddle with every thing, interrupt others, and ſpeak of things they underſtand not. It is the Sign of an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, light, indiſcreet, and ſometimes of a proud Mind. The Wiſeman ſays excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well,<note n="*" place="margin">Vidiſti ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem ad lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendum, ſtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia magis ſperandum eſt quam illius correctio. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.</note>

                  <p>In Converſation, when another ſpeaks,<note place="margin">How we muſt behave our ſelves in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</note> have a care of Three things. 1. Not to ſpeak before you have heard what he ſays. 2. Not to interrupt him who ſpeaks.

                  <head type="sub">Of other Vices of the Tongue, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of Swearing.</head>
                  <p>BEſides wicked and impertinent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes, and a Vanity in Talking, there are alſo many other Vices of the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:33523:171"/>Tongue, which Chriſtian Modeſty ought carefully to retrench; the firſt whereof is Swearing.</p>
                  <p>To be addicted to Swearing is a very vicious Quality, eſpecially in young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I ſpeak not of Oaths made by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to aſſure a Truth when ſufficient Neceſſity requires, a Neceſſity which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens to young Perſons; but of thoſe Oaths ſo common amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, where the adorable Name of God is employ'd and taken in vain, in the leaſt Anger, or firſt Impatience, and ſometimes by a ſetled Judgment from a deteſtable Cuſtom of Swearing by the Name of God in all manner of Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>This Sin is one of the wickedeſt Habits a Man can contract; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a Contempt of God,<note place="margin">Sanctum &amp; terribile no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ejus. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a notable Outrage offer'd to his Son <hi>Jeſus-Chriſt,</hi> to treat with ſo much Irreverence the precious Death he ſuffer'd for our Redemption, and the adorable Blood he ſhed for our Salvation.

                  <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">The Sin of the Devil.</note> It ſuffices to ſay, that this Sin is the Sin of the Devils, who are pleas'd in nothing but in abuſing the holy Name of God: And it is a horrible thing, that Chriſtians, who ought to Praiſe God upon Earth as the Angels Praiſe him in Heaven, ſhould offer him here the ſame Injuries as the Devils vomit out againſt him in Hell.</p>

                  <p>The Remedy of this Sin,<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> when one has never ſo little a Habit or Inclination to it, is to fly the Cauſes, as Anger, Plays of Hazard, wicked Company, and all other things, which every one knows to be to them an occaſion of Swearing.

                     <p>Detraction is another Sin of the Tongue which you ought not only to avoid, but abhor.</p>
                     <p>To Detract,<note place="margin">What Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is.</note> is to report of another a Sin able to defame him, which he hath not committed, or elſe a Sin which he hath committed, but is not known or publick; for as long as the Sin of our Neighbor is ſecret, to reveal it to them who knew it not, is to do him an Injury.</p>
                     <p>Detraction is ſometimes committed out of Malice,<note place="margin">It is done two ways.</note> as by Hatred, Revenge, Envy, or Deſign to hurt our Neighbor.

                     <p>Altho' the firſt manner of Detraction be moſt criminal, the ſecond nevertheleſs is not without Sin; for it always takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Reputation of our Neighbor, it obliges to repair the Honor he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of.

                  <p>AS young Men are extreamly addicted to Pleaſure,<note place="margin">Two Vices that hear ſway in young Perſons.</note> ſo they are exceſſively impatient in ſuffering things which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:33523:179"/>them. Theſe are the two Lording Paſſions which reign in Youth, and which precipitate them into all the Diſorders wee ſee. Look upon all the Vices and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances of Youth, conſider all the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes that befall them, and you will find they ſpring from one of theſe two Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, either from the Love of Pleaſures, or from Anger, and often from both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Theſe are the two Means the Devil employs to deſtroy young Men, being well aſſur'd, that if one ſucceeded not, the other would never fail. And it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen, that he ruins by Anger thoſe he cannot gain by Pleaſures, hurrying them by that impetuous Paſſion to moſt deplorable Misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>Theotime,</hi> as it is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant for you to moderate this Love of Pleaſures, ſo natural to your Age, of which we have hitherto ſpoken; ſo it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Entertainment for you, to labor to repreſs thoſe Motions of Choler, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that excellent Precept the Wiſeman gives you;<note n="*" place="margin">Aufer iram à corde tuo, &amp; amove mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam à carne tua. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Take away Anger from your Heart, and remove Malice from your Fleſh,</hi> that is to ſay, Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>There are ſo many Reaſons to fly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note place="margin">Powerful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to fly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> that it is a thing worthy of Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſee it ſhould be ſo common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men. I beſeech you, <hi>Theotime,</hi> weigh attentively theſe which follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Anger is a brutiſh Paſſion, which renders Men like Beaſts: For what is there liker an Animal, than a Man who cannot
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:33523:179"/>ſuffer the leaſt thing? Beaſts provoke themſelves againſt every thing that hurts them, becauſe they have no Reaſon; and if you ſtir up your ſelf againſt every thing which diſpleaſes you, in what are you dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from a Beaſt? And what do's your Reaſon ſerve for?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Anger proceeds ordinarily from a want of Wiſdom, or from the weakneſs of the Mind, which can ſuffer or diſſemble nothing, and diſcerns not the things which deſerve Anger, from thoſe which do not. If then you be inclin'd to Anger, you ſhew you have a weak Mind, and more fill'd with Folly than Wiſdom. This is the Judgment of the Wiſeman, who ſays, That<note n="*" place="margin">Fatuus ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim indicat iram. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. Ne ſis velox ad iraſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, quia ira in ſinu ſtulti requieſcit. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.</note> 
                     <hi>it belongs to Fools to fall preſently into Anger:</hi> He therefore gives you this excellent Admonition, <hi>Be not ſubject to fall into Choler, for Anger reſts in the boſom of the unwiſe;</hi> that is, Anger is proper and natural to ill-bred Minds.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Anger diſturbs the Judgment and Reaſon, and renders a Man uncapable of diſcerning Good from Bad, True from Falſe, Uſeful from Unprofitable. It makes one frequently take the one for the other, ſo that a Man in Anger hath nothing but the exterior Shape and Figure of a Man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Exterior it ſelf is in ſuch a manner chang'd, that it makes a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, his Eyes ſparkling, his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance pale, his Speech interrupted, his Body trembling, his Clamors, and other like Alterations, are the Effects of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:33523:180"/>which make a Man as it were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, Anger is abſolutely contrary to the Spirit of Chriſtianity.<note place="margin">Qui iraſcitur fratri ſuo reus erit judicii. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.

                     <head>Remedies againſt Anger.</head>
                     <p>If you be poſſeſs'd by this Paſſion, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> uſe all your Endeavors to moderate it: And for this intent read attentively the following Maxims, and attempt to practiſe them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Never be provok'd to Anger upon ſmall Occaſions: For Example, if one ſays ſome light Words to you, do's ſomething that diſpleaſes you; if a Servant be wanting to wait on you punctually; to be mov'd to Choler for theſe things is an Indiſcretion, and the Effect of an irregular Mind.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the Ill one hath done you be great, before you be troubled for it, ſee whether your Anger will ſerve to remedy it, and you will find moſt commonly, that it will be abſolutely unuſeful for that purpoſe; and if it be improfitable, it is a folly to vex your ſelf. For Example, One hath given you injurious Words, or ſpoken ill of you, when you fall into Paſſion, you will not repair the Injury nor the Detraction; you muſt then ſeek ſome other Means, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which Contempt is the beſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Suppoſe it be fitting ſometimes to manifeſt ſome Diſcontent for the Evil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hath done you, to hinder him from doing the ſame again, becauſe, according to the Wiſeman,<note place="margin">Per triftitiam vultus corrri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur animus delinquentis. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.</note> 
                        <hi>By the ſadneſs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Mind of him who hath fail'd, is corrected;</hi> yet nevertheleſs it can never be profitable, either to conceive Anger in
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:33523:181"/>ones Heart, or to brawl, ſtorm, affront, or offer Reproaches. On the contrary, it prejudices your good Repute, if you have any; and it is againſt Vertue, becauſe in all this you offend God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Be then always upon your guard to prevent Anger when you ſee it coming. Now if it ſometimes prevent you, before you have been able to divert it, endeavor to return quickly to your ſelf, and to be eaſily appeaſed. Well-bred Spirits are ſoon pacifi'd, according to the Judgment of the Poet;
<q>
                           <l>Quo quiſque eſt major, magis eſt placabilis ira,</l>
                           <l>Et faciles motus mens generoſa capit.</l>
                        </q> And as S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays excellently well,<note n="a" place="margin">Iraſci homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis eſt, finem imponere ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundiae, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiani. <hi>S. Hier. Epiſt. ad Dem.</hi>

                        <hi>It is natural to a Man to be angry, but it is the property of a Chriſtian to keep it within bounds.</hi>

O what an excellent Example is this, and which deſerves to be well conſider'd!</p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:33523:181"/>
                     <p n="5">5. When you ſhall be put into Paſſion, impoſe ſome Puniſhment upon your ſelf, as ſome Prayers, Alms, or other things; expreſs a trouble for it to thoſe who ſee you.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. There is ſcarce any Perſon but ſays or do's ſomething in his Anger, of which he repents himſelf after. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall be in Choler, reſtrain your ſelf as much as you can from ſaying or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing which Paſſion ſuggeſts. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe your ſelf when you are in Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; expect till it be paſt, to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a thing be ill ſpoken or done, and you will often find that it was not.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Entertain not your Thoughts with the Subject of your Diſpleaſure, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade your ſelf that you have juſt cauſe to be angry; this is but to cheriſh your Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: there is none but thinks he has a great deal of Reaſon when he is in Choler. On the contrary, convince your ſelf that you may be deceiv'd, and divert your Mind to another thing.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If you deſire to have an averſion for Anger, conſider another attentively when he is in Paſſion; you will ſee nothing in him and his Actions, but what will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe you. The ſame happens to you in reſpect of others, when you are angry: And if you ſhould ſee your ſelf in a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, you would be vexed at your ſelf, and would not endure your ſelf in that Condition.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Fly the Converſation of impatient
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:33523:182"/>and cholerick Men,<note place="margin">Noli eſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus homini iracundo ne forte diſcas ſemitas ejus. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.</note> according to that rare Precept of the Wiſeman, <hi>Contract not Friendſhip with a cholerick Man, leſt you learn his Humor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſine, accuſtom your ſelf to be affable and benign toward others, to excuſe their Faults, to forget Injuries, to pardon eaſily, not to be ſo delicate and ſenſible in the things which concern you, to ſpeak mildly to all.

                  <p>THere is yet a neceſſary thing conſerve Peace and Meekneſs towards our Neighbor, which is the Pardon of Injuries. It is a Vertue which muſt be learn'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, by ſo much ſooner as it is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, very rare amongſt Chriſtians, and yet abſolutely neceſſary for Salvation.</p>
                  <p>You muſt learn,<note place="margin">We muſt learn from our Youth to pardon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</note> dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Injuries which are offer'd you; that is, never to harbor in your Mind any hatred againſt your Neighbor, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Diſpleaſure you have receiv'd from him, not to have any deſire of Revenge, nor wiſh him any Ill; but on the contrary, deſire him Good, and ſhew him Kindneſs, when his Neceſſity, or other Edification require it.</p>
                  <p>You'll ſay that this is difficult. 'Tis true, but it is only hard to thoſe who have never conſider'd the Reaſons which oblige them to it;<note place="margin">Strong Reaſons to perſuade to the pardon of Injuries.</note> which are ſo ſtrong and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, that they who, after they have made never ſo little reflection on them, are not convinc'd, muſt needs have loſt all their Senſe and Judgment.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. This Will of God depends upon ſo manifeſt a Point of Equity, that even the moſt Obſtinate cannot contradict it. Is there any thing more Juſt, than that God ſhould treat you as you treat others, That he ſhould pardon you as you pardon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That he ſhould revenge himſelf of you, if you will be reveng'd of thoſe who have offended you? Is not this Juſt? Weigh well, <hi>Theotime,</hi> what I am going
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:33523:185"/>to ſay,<note place="margin">A Diſcourſe to be well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</note> You would have God infinite in Majeſty and Power, offended, by whom? By his own Creature, after he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon it all imaginable Favors, and offended moſt grievouſly, and with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Offence, for which neither you nor all Creatures together, altho' you ſhould joyn your Lamentations with them for all Eternity, could know how to make him worthy Satisfaction; injur'd, in fine, by an Offence which deſerves an Eternal Damnation, which cannot be avoided but by his pure Mercy, which he is not oblig'd to ſhew you. Would you, I ſay, deſire that a God ſo Great, offended by you ſo grievouſly, ſhould pardon you ſuch an Offence, and remit you ſuch a Puniſhment, and will not you pardon your Brother, one like to you, for a ſmall Offence? You who are a Sinner as he is, and who have need of Pardon as well as he; You who perhaps have wrong'd him firſt, or at leaſt have ſhew'd him to Kindneſs, or if you have, it is not comparable to that God hath ſhewn you; nay, moreover, that Favor you have done him, came not from you, but from God; Will you, I ſay, amongſt all theſe Conſiderations ſeek Revenge and Satisfaction for your Offence,<note place="margin">Qui vindicari vult à Domino inveniet vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictam. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo homini re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervat iram &amp; à Deo quaerit medelam, in hominem ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milem ſibi non habet miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiam, &amp; de peccatis ſuis deprecatur: ipſe cum caro ſit, reſervat iram, &amp; propitiationem petit à Deo. Quis exorabit pro peccatis illius? <hi>Eccl.</hi> 28.</note> and will not have God revenge himſelf of you? Are not you Unjuſt, yea, even Ridiculous? <hi>Man reſerves Anger for Man, and begs Mercy of God. He hath no Compaſſion of one like himſelf, and he would have God take pity upon him. He, miſerable and wretched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:33523:185"/>as he is, would revenge himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeches God that he would not revenge himſelf of him. Who is there,</hi> ſays the Wiſeman, <hi>will offer Prayers for his Sins?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Theotime,</hi> what have you to anſwer? Will you ſay that it is hard to pardon? Say alſo,<note place="margin">A convincing Anſwer to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Objections on this Subject.</note> that it is hard that you ſhould obtain pardon of your Sins from God. But you will ſay, I would freely pardon him, and not revenge my ſelf; but to love and wiſh him well who hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me, and would do me a Miſchief, this is that wherein I cannot overcome my ſelf. If it be ſo, grant then that you would not have God love you, nor beſtow upon you any Bleſſing; for he will treat you as you treat your Neighbor. Say that you will not love another like your ſelf, for the love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who hath lov'd you ſo as to Die for your Salvation; and that God having lov'd you when you were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, you will not love your Brother, except he be worthy of your Love. Say that you will not love your Neighbor for the love of God, but for the love of your ſelf only. And altho' God command you to love him who hath offended you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts you to it, and accounts the Love you render to one like you, as done to his own Perſon; yet all this is not capable to make you quit the Reſentment and hatred you
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:33523:186"/>bear in your Heart. Say, in fine, that you pretend nothing to the Grace of God, and Eternal Life, being the Scripture teaches us, That<note n="*" place="margin">Nos ſcimus quoniam tranſlati ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus de morte ad vitam quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam diligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus fratres.

                  </p>
                  <p>Let us conclude, <hi>Theotime,</hi> that either we muſt renounce Chriſtianity, the Love of God, and Eternal Salvation, or we muſt neceſſarily pardon Injuries, love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and render Good for Evil. But as this Vertue is difficult in the Corruption of Nature, and the Depravation of the World, which cannot reliſh it, you muſt learn it in good time,<note place="margin">Agnoſcit ſe eſſe hominem, qui novit ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcere, &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Chriſti ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur qui carne ſuſcepta maluit in hunc modum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire, quam judex. <hi>S.

                     </note> and demand it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of God. Beg of him, that he would give you a meek and peaceable Heart, and which loves to render Good for Evil.

                  <p>THIS Vertue is the Mother of the three former, and its Defects cauſe all the Diſorders we have ſpoken of in the three laſt Chapters: For Anger, Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Animoſities, Revenges, ſpring only from the want of Charity, and becauſe we love not our Neighbor Chriſtianly, and as God commands us to love him.</p>
                  <p>It is a thing of moſt Importance, that you be inſtructed in this Vertue, becauſe it is a Fundamental Vertue of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note n="*" place="margin">Diliges Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum Deum tuum ex toto corde, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximum ſicut te ipſum.</note> which is Eſtabliſh'd upon theſe two Laws, <hi>Love God above all things, and your Neighbor as your ſelf;</hi> and yet very rare, and badly practis'd amongſt Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>The generality of Chriſtians believe, That to love their Parents, their Friends,<note place="margin">A common Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror concerning the Love of our Neighbor.</note> and thoſe from whom they expect any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, is ſufficient, and accounts the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all other Men as indifferent. This is not to love our Neighbor, but our Selves. Children from their Youth are bred up in this Opinion, they are taught only to love thoſe who do them good, and hate thoſe who do them hurt. From hence ariſe all the Diſcords which disfigure the the Face of Chriſtianity, the Harſhneſs with which Men treat one another, the little Support they mutually give, the ſmall Aſſiſtance they afford them in their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:33523:187"/>From thence the Propenſity to Quarrels, Injuries, ill Treatments, Hatred, and Revenge.</p>
                  <p>It is very important to diſabuſe young Perſons of this common Error, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in this Vertue ſo neceſſary for Salvation.</p>
                  <p>This Error proceeds from three things which ought to be known in this Vertue; that is,<note place="margin">Three things to be known in the Love of our Neighbor.</note> Who are our Neighbors which muſt be lov'd, The Motive for which they muſt be lov'd, And in what this Love conſiſts.</p>

                        <hi>1.</hi> Who he is.</note> Our Neighbors which muſt be lov'd, are all Men, even the moſt unknown, Great and Mean, Poor and Rich, Good and Bad, Friend and Foe.</p>

                        <hi>2.</hi> The Motive to love him.</note> The Motive for which they muſt be lov'd, is becauſe they are all the Children of God, Created to his Image, Redeem'd by the Blood of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, who is our common Father, will have us love them as our Brethren, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is our common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior hath commanded us to love them.</p>

                        <hi>3.</hi> In what it conſiſts.</note> This Love conſiſts in three things, In deſiring Good to all; In doing it when we can, principally in their Temporal and Spiritual Good; And in ſupporting their Defects, and excuſing their Faults.</p>
                  <p>This is, <hi>Theotime,</hi> true Charity, which is one of the Foundations of Vertue, the Mark of a Chriſtian Spirit, without which we cannot pleaſe God, nor have any real Vertue, and wherein it is neceſſary you
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:33523:187"/>be exercis'd in good time to acquire it.</p>

Be meek and amiable to all, Have compaſſion on the Poor and Afflicted, Be not envious at the Rich, and all thoſe in Proſperity: Love the Good by reaſon of their Vertue, the Wicked that they may become Good; deſiring the Perſeverance of the former, and the Converſion of the latter. We muſt hate Sin, which is the Work of Man, but love Man, who is the Work of God.</p>

                     <hi>Compaſſion hath increas'd with me from my Infancy.</hi> Becauſe it will attract a great abundance of Divine Bleſſings upon them during all their Life, and at the Hour of our Death, as it is ſaid in the Scripture.</p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:33523:188"/>

If one be accus'd of a Wickeneſs which he hath not done, defend him, and ſay that it is not ſo. If one diſcover the Ill he hath done, endeavor to excuſe him, and hinder that it be not ſpoken of any more: Speak of ſome other Good he hath done, or ſome good Quality he is endow'd with: Shew that Detraction diſpleaſes you, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him who utters it, to ſpare the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his Neighbor.</p>
                  <p>As for the Good of the Soul,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Spiritual.</note> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Vertue and Salvation, ſince it is the greateſt of all Goods, you muſt uſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Means to procure it for your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. You will perform this by Praying for him, by endeavoring to withdraw him from Vice, and from ill Occaſions, when there are any, either by your ſelf, or by others who can prevail with him; by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing him mildly of his Duty, or cauſing him to be Admoniſh'd; by giving him good Counſel and good Example, and by other Means which Charity will ſuggeſt to you. Accuſtom your ſelf to do all theſe things to them you have moſt occaſion of, as to your Friends, your Companions, your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, your Servants, and to thoſe with whom you converſe. This is the true Love of our Neighbor, to love him for his Salvation, and Eternity.</p>
                  <p>There remains a Third thing neceſſary for the Love of our Neighbor,<note place="margin">To ſupport his Defects.</note> which is
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:33523:188"/>charitably to ſupport his Defects, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his Faults, as much as Prudence will permit:<note n="a" place="margin">Priuſquam interroges, ne vituperes quemquam: &amp; cum inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogaveris cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe juſte. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.</note> Not to be inclin'd to blame and reprehend, either without Knowledge, or with Bitterneſs, or without any Neceſſity or Profit.

                  <p>In fine, <hi>Theotime,</hi> the great Rule of the Love of our Neighbor, conſiſts in judging our Neighbor by our ſelves, according to the Maxim of the Wiſeman,<note n="b" place="margin">Intellige quae proximi ſunt ex teipſo. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 31.</note>

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:33523:189"/>Life very piouſly, if we have neglected the Salvation of others upon occaſions, the Sanctity of our Life ſhall be unprofitable, it being certain, that that Negligence is ſo criminal, that it alone may be the cauſe of our Damnation. He gives the Reaſon, Becauſe he who is wanting to aſſiſt his Neighbor in his corporal Neceſſities, is rejected by God at the Day of Judgment, notwithſtanding the Good he hath other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perform'd: Much more he who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to ſuccor his Brother in a thing of far greater Conſequence, as is the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Soul, will deſerve all manner of Puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>The Diſcharge of this great Obligation depends upon the practiſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Fraternal Correction which our Lord hath given us, and whereof he hath preſcrib'd the Order in Chap. 18. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in theſe Words,<note n="*" place="margin">Si peccave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in te frater tuus, vade &amp; corripe eum inter te &amp; ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum ſolum. Si te audierit, lucratus es fratrem tuum, ſi autem te non audierit, adhibe tecum unum vel duos, quod ſi non audierit eos, dic Eccleſiae. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</note> 
                     <hi>If your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin againſt you, go and reprehend him ſecretly; if he hear you, you have gained him; if he hear you not, take one or two others with you, if he will not hear them, tell the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That you may underſtand this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,<note place="margin">Five things of Conſequence to be obſerv'd in this Command.</note> ſo much unknown, and ſo ill practis'd, I ſhall obſerve here four or five things, which will facilitate the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Practiſe of it.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is the End of this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Its End.</note> which is to remedy the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:33523:190"/>of our Neighbor, that is, to hinder that our Neighbor who hath ſinn'd, may not relapſe into his Fault, or that others do not offend by his Example or Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The Second is,<note place="margin">The Perſons it obliges.</note> That this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obliges not only Superiors, but all ſorts of Perſons, it being a Command of Charity, which, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaith, every one is oblig'd to have.</p>
                  <p>The Third is,<note place="margin">The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein it obliges.</note> That this Obligation is underſtood only when theſe two Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances occur. 1. When we know the Ill committed, and the apparent danger that our Neighbor will relapſe into it, or cauſe others to fall therein. 2. When we may hinder the Evil of another, and bring ſome Remedy for it.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth is, That this Power of ſtopping the Miſchief, is not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of what we our ſelves may do, but alſo of what we may effect by anothers means. This is what our Lord made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, in ſaying, If he hear not you, take ſome other Perſon with you; and if he ſtill continue to perſiſt, tell the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Remark is, That what he ſays of telling the Church, that is, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, may be perform'd either privately or publickly; and that when the Firſt Way, that is, the ſecret, ſuffices to hinder the Misfortune, as ordinarily it doth, we are not oblig'd to the Second.</p>
                  <p>Thus to collect all theſe Obſervations,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:33523:190"/>and joyn them together; The Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fraternal Correction obliges eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to hinder the Evil or Sin of another, when he knows it, and can remedy it, by himſelf or by other Perſons, which may be employ'd for that effect. From whence it follows, That to diſcharge ones ſelf of the Obligation of this Commandment, one is oblig'd to divert the Miſchief by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when one cannot by himſelf.</p>
                  <p>We have already manifeſted the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Obligation, in which one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail without a heinous Sin, and the neglect of it will be found moſt reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at the Divine Judgment. In effect, <hi>Theotime,</hi> is it not a highly criminal thing before God, to ſee or know any one in the danger of his Soul, and contemn the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he might afford him in that State? And to be concern'd no more to hinder his Neighbor from mortally offending God when he can, than to divert him from drinking a Glaſs of Water?<note n="a" place="margin">Qui habue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am hujus mundi &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derit fratrem ſuum neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem habere, &amp; clauſerit viſcera ſua ab eo, quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do charitas Dei manet in eo? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>If any one</hi> (ſays S. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>ſees his brother in neceſſity, and ſhutteth up his Compaſſion from him, when he hath wherewithal to aſſiſt him, how dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the love of God in him?</hi> If this be ſo in Corporal Neceſſities, what will it be in Spiritual?<note n="b" place="margin">S.

                     <hi>If the Old Law</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) <hi>ſtrictly commanded not to neglect the Ox of ones Enemy when he is found ſtray'd, but to bring him back to his Maſter; what Pardon ought he to expect, who neglects and abandons not a ſtray'd Ox of his Enemy, but the Soul of his Brother Chriſtian loſt in Sin?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>If your Brother</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) <hi>had a mortal Wound upon his Body, which he would conceal for fear of Inciſion, would it not be an Inhumanity in you, to conſpire by your Silence with him in his Deſign? as on the contrary, you would ſhew him a great Kindneſs, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Diſtemper to a Phyſician, to apply a Remedy to it. With how much more reaſon ought you to do the ſame thing for the Wounds of his Soul, ſince they are far more dangerous to be neglected, and permitted to putrifie in the Heart, leſt they cauſe Death in him, and infect others with their Stench.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſine, if you ſhould ſee the beginning of a Fire, which you might eaſily put out either by your ſelf, or at leaſt by adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing others who might do it, would you not be guilty of all the Burning if you were defective therein? How many mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sins are there committed in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch a like Negligence as this?</p>
                  <p>Conſider, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and weigh well all
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:33523:191"/>theſe Reaſons. What would you anſwer to God in his dreadful Judgment, if thro' Remiſsneſs, or ſome vain Fear, or ſome miſerable Complacence, as it frequently happens, you ſhould be ſo misfortunate as to fall into that criminal Negligence? What Reaſon could you alledge which had hinder'd you? What is the Salvation of a Soul worth, or one mortal Sin which you might divert? What will you ſay when you ſhall be reproach'd, that you had more apprehenſion of diſpleaſing your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, than of offending God; and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by Indiſcretion, Anger, or Malice, you were not afraid to divulge the ſame thing, which you would not diſcover ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly by Charity? But what will you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer when it ſhall be made appear, that you might have often hindred the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of another, without any Danger, and that you had only an imaginary Fear, or rather a great Slackneſs, or fooliſh Complacence, which hath hinder'd you from it? You will then ſee your ſelf cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Sins of another, and charg'd with many Faults which you might have hinder'd, and which were caus'd by your Silence: God will exact an Account of you for them.</p>
                  <p>You muſt avoid this Misfortune, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time;</hi> and to perform it, practiſe what the Son of God hath preſcrib'd us. When you ſee any one offend God mortally, as by Swearing, Talking uncivilly, Soliciting you to Wickedneſs, or know of any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:33523:192"/>Diſorder, endeavor to divert him from it, if you can, by your mild and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Admonitions. If you cannot, as not having ſufficient Boldneſs to do it, or ſufficient Authority to hinder it, do what our Lord appoints you, employ diſcreetly other Perſons therein, which you know can perform it better than you, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe who have the Conduct of him, whom you know to have gone aſtray.</p>
                  <p>This is the Rule which S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> after our Lord, gives on this Occaſion, in his 109. Epiſtle, where he adds theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Words, which are inſerted in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law;<note n="*" place="margin">Non vos ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicetis eſſe malevolos, quando cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alterius judicatis: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis quippe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentes non eſtis, ſi fratres veſtros quos judicando corrigere poteſtis, tacendo perire permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titis. <hi>S.

                     <hi>Believe not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that it is to do hurt to your Neighbor, to diſcover thus his Wickedneſs to cure it: On the contrary, you are guilty of his Ruin, if when you might heal his Evil by declaring it to the Phyſician, you permit him to periſh by your Silence.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he adds a Compariſon cited above.</p>
                  <p>Now if we muſt act thus even when the Neighbor's Sin hurts but him alone,<note place="margin">Quaedam ſunt peccata occul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta quae ſunt in nocumento proximorum vel corporale vel ſpirituale, &amp; quia ille qui ſic occulte peccat, non ſolum in te peccat, ſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam in alios, oporter ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim procedere ad denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem ut hujuſmodi nocumentum impediatur. <hi>S.

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:33523:192"/>another, or of many, following that Rule of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> and other Divines.</p>
                  <p>For Concluſion, <hi>Theotime,</hi> I ſhall give you that excellent Saying of S. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle to meditate on.<note n="*" place="margin">Fratres mei, ſi quis ex vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis erraverit a veritate, &amp; converti fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit quis eum, ſcire debet quoniam qui converti fecerit peccatorem ab errore viae ſuae, ſalvabit animam ejus à morte &amp; operiet multitudinem peccatorum. <hi>Jacob.</hi> 5.</note>

                  <head>CHAP. XIX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of Friendſhips.</head>
                  <p>I Speak here of Friendſhips, becauſe they conduce much to bring Youth to Good or Evil, according as they are good or bad; and ſince young People are much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Love, and beſides, not having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Light to diſcern good Friendſhip from hurtful, it often falls out that they contract very bad Friendſhips, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice them very much, and are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the cauſe of their Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>There is a difference between the Love of our Neighbor and Friendſhip. We muſt love all Men in the manner we have ſaid,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:33523:193"/>but we cannot have Friendſhip with all Men, becauſe Friendſhip is a mutual and particular Love.</p>
                  <p>It is a reciprocal Communication of Affections,<note place="margin">What Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is.</note> by which two Perſons parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly love one another, and mutually procure Good to one another.</p>
                  <p>Friendſhip is ſuch as is the Subject on which it is founded; if we love in a Friend a wicked thing, the Friendſhip is bad and vicious. If we love a vain and frivolous thing, as Beauty, good Behavior, the Friendſhip is frivolous and impertinent. If we love a good thing, the Friendſhip is good and laudable. Now this good thing muſt be a real Vertue, or a Perfection which may advance Vertue, as Science, a good Nature, or the like.</p>
                  <p>Friendſhip to be good and real,<note place="margin">Three Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be good.</note> ought to have three Conditions, which you muſt obſerve well. It muſt be founded upon Vertue, Tending to Vertue, and Conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Vertue.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It muſt be built upon Vertue, that is, we muſt love a Friend by reaſon of ſome good and laudable Quality, which we know in him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tending to Vertue, becauſe Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ought to deſire and procure the Good of a Friend. Now Vertue is the greateſt and moſt neceſſary of all Goods: And the Friendſhip by which Friends procure Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to one another, if it neglect mutually to advance Vertue according to its power, is not a Friendſhip, but a manifeſt Deceit.</p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:33523:193"/>
                  <p n="3">3. It ought to be directed by Vertue, that is, Vertue ought to be the Rule of it,<note place="margin">Amicus uſque ad aras.</note> and a Friend ſhould do nothing to a Friend which may be contrary to Vertue. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which cauſes God to be offended by a Friend, is a deteſtable and curſed Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe it makes one love Man more than God.</p>
                  <p>By theſe three Conditions, <hi>Theotime,</hi> you will eaſily diſcern good Friendſhip from evil, and thoſe you ought to fly, from thoſe you ought to ſeek.</p>
                  <p>You ought to fly the Friendſhip of thoſe in whom you find no Vertue, nor any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which you may love, as alſo the Friendſhip of thoſe you know to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any Vice, as to Impurity, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Swearing, whoſe Friendſhip will make you learn their wicked Quallties; becauſe, as the Wiſeman ſays,<note place="margin">Amicus ſtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum ſimilis efficietur. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.</note> 
                     <hi>A Friend of Fools,</hi> that is, of vicious People, <hi>will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fly all Friendſhip which doth not tend to make you better. Such is the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of thoſe who ſearch after nothing in your Love but their own Profit, or ſome vain Complacence they take in loving you, or being belov'd by you; of thoſe, who when they can, do not advertiſe you of your Good and Salvation. But above all, abhor the Friendſhip of thoſe who ſolicit you to Sin,<note place="margin">Vir iniquus lactat a micum ſuum &amp; ducit eum per viam non bonam. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.</note> or flatter and cheriſh you in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces you have. You ought to avoid theſe Friends, as your greateſt and moſt mortal Enemies.</p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:33523:194"/>
                  <p>Avoid the Company of all thoſe who ſcruple not to offend God for your ſake, and to pleaſe you; for Example, to Rob, to Cheat, to Quarrel, to Swear, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, to treat ill their Neighbor, to Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge in a Duel, and other ſuch like things. Have a horror for theſe Friendſhips, and account that Maxim for certain,<note place="margin">Non poteſt homini eſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus qui Deo fuerit infidus. <hi>S. Amb.</hi> 3. <hi>Offic. cap.</hi> 19.</note> That <hi>he who is unfaithful to God, cannot be a Friend to a Man;</hi> And altho' he might, yet you cannot adhere to that Friendſhip, without making your ſelf an Enemy to God.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, ſeek after the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of thoſe who you know carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well, and are endow'd with ſome good Qualities,<note place="margin">Melior eſt maniſeſta cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptio, quam amor abſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus.

Theſe, <hi>Theotime,</hi> are the good and real Friendſhips you muſt by ſo much more ſeek after, as they are moſt rare, and carefully entertain when you have found them. Theſe are the Friendſhips whereof the Wiſeman ſpeaks, when he ſays, that<note n="*" place="margin">Amicus fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis protectio fortis, qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venit illum invenit the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaurum; amico fideli nulla eſt comparatio, amicus fidelis medicamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum vitae &amp; immortalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6.</note>

                  <head type="sub">Of Sports and Recreations.</head>
                  <p>REcreation is neceſſary to relax the Spirits, and particularly of young People; and that which is taken in Sports is moſt proper for them, it being more proportion'd to their Nature, and the Capacity of their Mind.</p>
                  <p>Paſtime then and Recreation is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Vertue, but rather commanded, and it is an Action of Vertue when it is done as it ought.</p>
                  <p>To be ſuch,<note place="margin">The Motive of Sport.</note> it is neceſſary before all things that the Motive of it be good; that is, that it be taken to recreate the Mind, and to make it more capable of Labor, which it could not be able to undergo, if it were always employ'd. So that Labor
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:33523:195"/>is the End and Motive of Sport and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
                  <p>From thence three Conditions follow,<note place="margin">Three Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</note> which muſt be obſerv'd in Play, that it may be good and vertuous.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt,<note place="margin">Moderation.</note> To keep therein a civil Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; for if it be taken in exceſs, it is no more a Recreation, but rather an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; it is not to Play to be made more fit for Labor, which is the ſole End Paſtime ought to have, but only for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which is a vicious End; yea, it is to make one unſit for Labor, becauſe exceſs of Play diſſipates the Spirits, enfeebles the Forces of the Body, and oftentimes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably prejudices the Health by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers it cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The Second Condition is,<note place="margin">An orderly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> Not to have a diſorderly Affection to Play, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens frequently to young Perſons.

                  <p>ALtho' it may ſeem that Covetouſneſs is not an ordinary Vice amongſt young Perſons,<note place="margin">Youth muſt be arm'd againſt Covetouſneſs.</note> yet it is very neceſſary to arm them againſt this Paſſion, which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily taking root in young Souls, is inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly augmented, and cauſes vaſt Diſorders in their Life.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of Covetouſneſs;<note place="margin">Two ſorts of Covetouſneſs.</note> The one, which makes us love Mony, to heap it up, to get Treaſures and Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; The other, which makes us affect it, to diſpoſe and employ it for our proper Pleaſures. The Firſt is very rare amongſt young People, but the Second is very ordinary with them, and highly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial.</p>
                  <p>Experience makes appear that it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary with them;<note place="margin">How ordinary among young Perſons.</note> for as they earneſtly love their Pleaſures, they ſeek after all Means to ſatisfie them, which cannot be effected without Mony: From hence it comes that they apply all their Endeavors to get it; From hence the Cheats and Tricks they make uſe of towards their
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:33523:196"/>Parents, to get it from them; From hence their Cozening in Play, their Hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to the Poor, and ſometimes Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and unjuſt Ways to procure it; From hence the love of Riches, which we ſee in young Spirits, the deſires of great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, the imaginary Deſigns they lay to purchaſe them.</p>
                  <p>This Paſſion having thus taken its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in Youth, eaſily increaſes,<note place="margin">How prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</note> and ſtrengthening it ſelf by Age becomes ſo ſtrangely rooted, that it can never be pull'd up all the remainder of their Life. And it cauſes that ſo general a Diſorder which is found amongſt Chriſtians, and which the Prophet deplores when he ſays, that<note n="a" place="margin">A minore uſque ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorem omnes avaritiae ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.13.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Vice takes its origin from three Cauſes in Youth. The Firſt is,<note place="margin">Three Cauſes of Avarice in young Men.</note> what we have now ſpoken of. The Second is, the common Example of the World, which they ſee loves and eſteems Mony above all things, and runs after it with inſatiable greedineſs. The Third is the Fault of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who inſpire this Love into their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from their tender Years, Diſcourſing of nothing but the Care to get their Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, if they be Mean or Poor, or of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and aſpiring to a higher Fortune, if they be Rich; teaching thus their Children

This Choice is a Subject, whoſe Knowledge is by ſo much more neceſſary to young Perſons, as its Importance is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the greateſt part of Men, and the Faults that are there committed are moſt commonly irreparable; or if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

For this reaſon, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> I beſeech you read attentively this laſt Part, whether before you enter upon this Deliberation, or when you ſhall be at the Point of making your Choice, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo after you have made it; for you will find therein whereby to profit at each of thoſe Times.</p>
               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">How important it is to make a good Choice of a State of Life.</head>
                  <p>THIS Importance is built upon two Truths,<note place="margin">Two Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths in this matter.</note> which are to be ſuppoſed here as Fundamental in this matter.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, That altho' all States may be good, yet all States are not good for every one; and that ſuch a State is profitable for one Man which will be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for another, all not having the ſame Inclinations, nor the ſame Capacities, nor the ſame Favors of God.</p>
                  <p>The Second is, That God who hath Eſtabliſh'd by his Providence the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of States and Employments of the Life of Man, diſtributes them differently
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:33523:203"/>by his Wiſdom, deſigning ſome for one Employment, others for another: As a Father of a Family divides amongſt his Domeſticks the Offices of his Houſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he finds them fit. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he gives to Men different Inclinations, divers natural Abilities, as well Corporal as Spiritual; and alſo diſtributes amongſt them his Favors diverſly, according to the ſeveral Neceſſities of different States, to which he calls them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Truths thus preſuppos'd, evidently manifeſt how important it is to chooſe well ones State and Condition: For if all States are not good for all, it is then moſt important to chooſe adviſedly, that we may not fall into a State which may be contrary to us. And if God call each Man to one State more particularly than another, it follows that we muſt proceed therein with a great Circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to chooſe what is moſt conformable to his Will, and for which he hath given us moſt Capacity, and prepar'd moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors.</p>
                  <p>This choice is of ſuch conſequence,<note place="margin">How important the Choice of a State is.</note> that on it depends all the Good of a Man, both for this Life, and for Eternal Salvation. Be attentive, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to comprehend the Miſchiefs into which all ill Choice of a Condition caſts Men, and into which it will caſt you, if you be defective therein.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life.</note> for the preſent Life, What Good, what Contentment can he have, who is enter'd into a State which he hath ill cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:33523:203"/>and for which he is not proper? There is no Condition more miſerable. The Diſpleaſure of ſeeing himſelf engag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Inclination, joyn'd with the Difficulties he undergoes to acquit himſelf of his Duty, caſts him into a Diſquiet and Melancholy, which inceſſantly gnaws him, makes him inſupportable to others, and himſelf, and find in his Condition a more horrid Priſon than that of Criminals, and Chains more unmerciful than thoſe of Gally-ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>As for Salvation,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> For Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> what can a Man do in that State? For beſides that Melancholy caſts him into a continual Idleneſs, and that Idleneſs into Vice and Perdition; With what trouble muſt he effect his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in a State wherein he hath neither Ability, nor Vocation from God? The want of theſe two things are the Cauſes why he will commit an infinit number of ſins, which he would not have done in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther State. The defect of Capacity makes him find continual Difficulties in ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Duty, and the particular Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his State. The defect of Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the Cauſe why he wants many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors he ſhould have receiv'd in another Calling, and of which he is made unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, being enter'd raſhly into this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without conſulting God, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of him his Will. And certainly, if we ſearch into the Cauſe of the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders we ſee in each State, Eccleſiaſtical, Religious, and Secular, wherein many
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:33523:204"/>diſcharge themſelves of their Duty very badly, we ſhall find the greateſt part of the Miſchiefs ſpring from this Source, that is, from an ill Entrance into a State of Life; and that the greateſt part enter upon ſlight Grounds, without Examining whether they are proper for it, and call'd by God.</p>
                  <p>For a Concluſion of this Importance,<note place="margin">A profitable Advice.</note> I exhort all thoſe who deliberate about the Choice of their State, attentively to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon theſe three things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Upon the Diſpleaſure and Sadneſs they will feel all their Life, for having made an ill Choice of their Calling.</item>
                     <item>2. The great number of Sins they will commit in a State they had lightly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and which they would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in another Condition.</item>
                     <item>3. The Danger to which they expoſe their Salvation, in chooſing after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>They who will attentively conſider theſe three things, will take care not to be defective in an Affair of this Importance.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Faults that are ordinarily committed in this Choice.</head>
                  <p>I Find four ſorts of Faults which young Men are accuſtom'd to fall into,<note place="margin">Four ordinary Faults in this Choice.</note> in this ſo important a Choice, which are the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:33523:204"/>Cauſes why they ſucceed therein ſo very badly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1.</hi> They delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate not.</note> They deliberate not at all upon this Choice, and inſtead of chooſing a State according to the Rules of Reaſon, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and ſerious Deliberation, they engage themſelves in a Calling ſometimes by a ſudden Paſſion and Fancy, ſometimes by Occaſion, and frequently by the ſole Inclination they feel to one Condition ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than another, without Examining whether they are proper for it, whether it be for their Good, and whether they ſhall effect therein their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When they deliberate,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> They delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ill.</note> they propoſe things naughtily, that is, upon ill Grounds, and regard other Ends than ſuch as they ought to have before their Eyes in this Deliberation. Some look upon the Sweetneſs of Life in the State they would embrace; Others upon Riches and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; Others upon Honor and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; And in a word, all regard Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Goods, and the preſent Life; but few propoſe Vertue and Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which chiefly, and before all things ought to be conſider'd. One ſays, This is proper to promote me in the World, and advance my Fortune; but he doth not ſay it is fit to promote me in Vertue, and effect my Salvation; or elſe it is not ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me, becauſe I foreſee I ſhall offend God in many Occurrences; I ſee therein Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations I cannot ſatisfie, many Occaſions and Dangers of ruining me.</p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:33523:205"/>
                  <p>This Fault is great, and againſt all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for, to deliberate wiſely of the State wherein we muſt ſpend our Life, we muſt caſt our Eye upon the End for which our Life is given us: This End is the Service of God, and the Salvation of our Souls. We muſt then refer the Calling we chooſe to that; to do otherwiſe is to ſtray out of the Way at the beginning, and ſuffer Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck in the Port.</p>
                  <p>The Third Fault is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Without Counſel.</note> That in delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Condition they ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, they only conſult with themſelves, without communicating, or asking Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of any one. This Fault is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt young People, and beſides, one of the greateſt they can commit in this Choice: For what appearance is there of deliberating well of the moſt important Affair of our Life, in an Age wherein we have as yet neither Judgment nor Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of any thing, without taking Counſel of wiſe and diſcreet Perſons? This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be the effect of an inſupportable Raſhneſs, or certainly of a great Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which deſerves ſo much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, as it is the cauſe of many Miſchiefs. If the Wiſeman recommend ſo much to young People,<note n="*" place="margin">Ne innita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris prudentiae tuae. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. Fili, ſine conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio nihil faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, &amp; poſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum non poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitebit. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 32.</note> 
                     <hi>Not to truſt to their own Judgment, to do nothing without Counſel,</hi> is it not in this ſo important Affair, more than in any other, where they ought to follow the Advice of the Holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Obſerve well this Fault, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil oft makes uſe of it to deceive young
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:33523:205"/>Perſons in the Choice of their Calling. We ſhall tell you hereafter with what kind of Perſons you ſhould conſult in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
                  <p>There is a Fourth Fault yet more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>4.</hi> They conſult not God.</note> which is, That in this Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they conſult not him who ought to be conſulted with above all others, <hi>viz.</hi> God himſelf: They have no recourſe to him by Prayer, humbly to demand of him his holy Inſpirations, and Grace to know his Will, altho' it be by him alone that we can ſucceed well in this Choice. He is the Father of Lights, he is the Author of good Counſels. Beſides, it belongs to him to give us our Calling, and the Employment wherein he would have us ſerve him in this Life, we muſt receive it from his Hands. He hath a mind that we ſhould have recourſe to him, and to adviſe with him in important Affairs; he accounts himſelf offended when we are defective therein, and frequently he gives us not his Bleſſing. See a convincing Example.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> deſirous to ſly the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Enemies, took a Reſolution to return into Egypt, out of their own Heads, without conſulting God to know what they ſhould do. He reproach'd them exceedingly by his Prophet, and threatned them that their Deſign ſhould not ſucceed, but have a dreadful iſſue, as in effect it had.<note n="*" place="margin">Vae filii de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteres, ut faceretis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filium, &amp; non ex me ordire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini telam, &amp; non per ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum meum, ut adderetis pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum ſuper peccatum, qui ambulatis ut deſcendatis in Aegyptum, &amp; os meum non interrogaſtis, erit vobis fortitudo Pharaonis in confuſionem, &amp; fiducia umbrae Aegyptiae in ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.</note> 
                     <hi>Wo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be to you fugitive Children, who abandon me to enter upon a Deſign without conſulting me, and to begin an Enterpriſe
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:33523:206"/>without expecting my Will; adding to your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sins a new one, of taking your Reſolution without my Counſel. Your Deſign ſhall turn to your Misfortune and Confuſion.</hi> I would to God all thoſe who deliberate of the Choice of their State, had frequently theſe Words in their Memory.</p>

                  <p>I promote this Means,<note place="margin">The Sins of Youth the cauſe of an ill Choice.</note> 
                     <hi>Theotime,</hi> to teach you betimes a Truth which the greateſt part of Men are ignorant of, or learn it too late, which is, That there is no greater Obſtacle to the Choice of a happy Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the Sins of Youth; and that the moſt ordinary Cauſe of the bad Election
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:33523:206"/>many make of their Condition, is a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Life, and full of Sins, which they lead whilſt they are young.</p>
                  <p>It is not hard to manifeſt this Truth,<note place="margin">The Proof.</note> which many experience daily too much, God, in puniſhment of their Sins, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording them the Favor to know the Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper for them, abandons them in this Choice of ſo great Importance, as they have deſerted his Service: He denies them high Light, as they have refus'd him their Obedience and Love. They have given their firſt Years to the Devil, and God permits alſo that the Devil ſhould deceive them in this Election, making them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a State contrary to their Good. And as they would not hearken to the Voice of his Commandments, and holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, he alſo gives not ear unto them when they have need of his Aſſiſtance.<note n="*" place="margin">In vocabunt me &amp; non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audiam, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne conſurgent &amp; non inveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent me eo quod exoſam habuerint diſciplinam, &amp; timorem Domini non ſuſceperint. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.</note>

                  <p>The Hiſtory of Kings furniſhes us with a terrible Example of this Verity in the Perſon of <hi>Saul</hi> firſt King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A notable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>1</hi> Reg. <hi>28.</hi>
                     </note> This Prince had excited the Choler of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, by his Diſobediences and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitudes. One day he found himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to a great Extremity, environ'd by his Enemies with this Army, and in the neceſſity of either engaging in a Fight, or infallibly periſhing. Not knowing what to reſolve on, he ſends to the Prieſts and Prophets to conſult God, and know what he muſt do in this ſo preſſing an Occaſion. But God, who was diſpleas'd at him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd nothing, nor made his Will known to Prieſt or Prophet.<note n="*" place="margin">Conſuluit Dominum, &amp; non reſpondit ei neque per Somnia, neque per Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, neque per Prophetas.</note> 
                     <hi>He conſults God,</hi> ſays the Scripture, <hi>who anſwer'd nothing,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:33523:207"/>neither by Dreams, nor Prieſts, nor Prophets.</hi> This misfortunate Prince ſeeing himſelf thus abandon'd by God, is wholly bent on a Reſolution Deſpair prompted. He goes himſelf to conſult a Witch, and asks of her that ſhe would bring him to the ſight of the Ghoſt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was dead a little before, and had been a Father and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to him. Happy had he been, if he had always follow'd the Counſel of that Man of God. God permits that this wicked Means ſhould ſucceed, and the Ghoſt of <hi>Samuel</hi> appear'd to him, but it was only that he might learn from him his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.<note n="*" place="margin">Quid me interrogas cum Dominus receſſerit à te? faciet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim tibi Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus ſicut lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutus eſt in manu mea.

                     <hi>Why doſt thou ask me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> to him, <hi>ſince God hath forſaken thee? Know, that God will accompliſh in thee all that he hath foretold by my Mouth, becauſe thou haſt not obey'd his Voice; and it is in puniſhment of that Diſobedience that he hath abandon'd thee in this Neceſſity, and not anſwer'd thee to Day; and beſides, before to Morrow paſs, thou ſhalt be conquer'd by thy Enemies, and ſhalt die together with thy Children.</hi> All which punctually fell out.</p>
                  <p>O what a frightful Example is this! to manifeſt the Truth we here eſtabliſh'd, of the Rejection of God in the moſt ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Neceſſities, in puniſhment of former Sins. And I would to God it were as rare as it is terrible, and that it were not daily renew'd in ſo many young Perſons, whom
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:33523:208"/>God abandons in this ſo important an Affair, of the Choice of their Calling, by reaſon of the Sins of their Youth; for what elſe is it which we ſee in many? Some chooſe a State quite contrary to their Good and Salvation, and which is often the cauſe of either their Temporal or Eternal Ruin. Others continue in a long and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Irreſolution, which hinders them from reſolving upon any State or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes them loſe the beſt part of their Life, which they ſpend thus in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and frequently in Vice. Others toſs'd with a perpetual Inconſtancy, are diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all ſorts of Callings; have ſcarce made choice of one, but ſeek after and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire another, which hinders them from ever ſucceeding in any. Are not all theſe things, I ſay, viſible and manifeſt Effects of the Puniſhment of God for the Sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Youth? And we may ſay with truth to every one of them, as <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul, Quia non credidiſti voci Domini, id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circo quod pateris, fecit tibi Dominus hodie; That which thou ſuffereſt at preſent, is in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Diſobediences thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God.</hi>

                  <p>For Concluſion, <hi>Theotime,</hi> I give you this Advertiſement, which you can never relfect on too much. If you be not already at the Time and Age of chooſing your State, have a care to live ſo in the Fear of God, and in the Flight of Sin, that you deſerve not to be abandon'd of his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when you ſhall be at the time of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:33523:208"/>making this ſo important a Choice, but draw upon you, by your good Life, his Bleſſing to ſucceed happily therein.</p>
                  <p>Now if you be at the Time of making this Choice, take notice how you have liv'd hitherto, before you deliberate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: And if your Life hath been ſinful, have a care of chooſing yet, but firſt take time to amend your Life, to do Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and to be entirely converted to God, to the end your ſins may not be the Cauſe why God deſerts you in this Choice. I tell you, <hi>Theotime,</hi> if you make your Election in that State, you expoſe your ſelf to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent danger of deceiving your ſelf, and ſucceeding misfortunately in the Choice you ſhall make.</p>

Give Alms according to your power, and alſo perform ſome Faſts for this Intention. Recommend this Affair to the Prayers of your Friends. Let all the Good you do be referr'd to that End, that is, to obtain of God the Grace to chooſe well your Calling. 4. Apply ſome Hour of the Day to think ſeriouſly on the State you muſt chooſe, and to deliberate of it within your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing to be Examin'd in this Deliberation,<note place="margin">Three things to be done in this Deliberation.</note> is the choice of two general States, under which all others are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; that is, the State of Continence,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:33523:212"/>and that of Marriage. The State of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence compriſes principally the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and Religious State, the State of Marriage comprehends the different Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the World.</p>
                  <p>Examin firſt theſe two general States, and obſerve whether you be indifferent, or have an Inclination to one of them.</p>
                  <p>If you be indifferent, take time to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min ſeriouſly both of them in the ſight of God, and with a Deſign to chooſe that of the two which you ſhall find, after a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deliberation and with good Counſel, to be the better, and moſt proper for you.</p>
                  <p>If you be inclin'd, and carry'd to one of theſe two States, have a care not to follow preſently your Inclination, but Examin it diligently, and a long time.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, if it be to a Lay State, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether you have had this Inclination a long time; Whether it be a good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that carries you to that State; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not a greedineſs after Riches, a love of Pleaſure or Ambition, as it often happens. Call to mind the Difficulties, and Obligations of that State; and to know them more eaſily, deſcend to the particular Callings of the World, which you may moſt likely embrace. For this effect read what ſhall be ſaid thereof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in Chap. 11. and 12. Beſeech God that he would make you know his Will, and not permit you to embrace that State, unleſs it be to ſerve him. Proteſt to him, that this is your Deſign, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:33523:212"/>any Inclination you have for that Condition, you will quit your ſelf of it, if he ſhall make it known to you that it is not his Will. Baniſh from your Mind all bad Motives of Pleaſure, Covetouſneſs, Ambition, and Vanity; and propoſe no other than that of ſerving God, and doing his Will. When you have propos'd all theſe things during a good ſpace of time, if this Inclination continue with you, you may in the Name of God embrace that State, propoſing chiefly to your ſelf, to comport your ſelf therein as a vertuous Man, to avoid the Dangers of it, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your Obligations, and always to have the Fear of God for the Rule of your Actions, and of all your whole Life. But in chooſing amongſt the Callings of the World, have a care not to take thoſe wherein you ſee many Dangers of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and ruining your ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now if you perceive your ſelf to be mov'd to the State of Continence, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Religious, as you muſt have a very particular Vocation to theſe two States, ſo you muſt ſeriouſly examin it, and reſolve nothing therein, till after you have demanded a long time of God the Grace to know it, after you have conſider'd a good while the Difficulties and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the State you would chooſe; and when you have taken good Counſel in it, we ſhall tell you hereafter what you muſt do in the choice of theſe two Callings.</p>
                  <p>In fine, <hi>Theotime,</hi> during all the time of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:33523:213"/>your Deliberation, Confer often with your Ghoſtly Father, declare to him all that you obſerve in your ſelf, the Inclinations and Repugnances you find to divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, the Difficulties you apprehend therein, the Motives that incline you rather to one State than another: Add thereunto alſo the Counſel of ſome other Perſons, ſuppoſing they have the Qualities we are about to ſpeak of.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Qualities thoſe ought to have of whom Counſel is to be taken for the Choice of a State of Life.</head>
                  <p>THERE is no Queſtion but you muſt principally conſult in this Choice, him who hath knowledge of your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there being none who can ſee more clearly in this Affair than he, ſince it is often an obſcure, doubtful, and difficult Buſineſs to reſolve on, even with that Knowledge. But he muſt be a ſelect Man, endow'd with much Vertue, with a moſt ſingular Prudence, and one who obſerves exactly the following Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let him not undertake to conduct another in this Choice, until he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his Prayers to God for that effect, and know whether he will make uſe of him in this Occaſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let him in this Direction regard
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:33523:213"/>nothing but God, and the Salvation of him whom he Conducts, and let him have no other Deſign but to ſeek the Will of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let him ſtrip himſelf of all Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he may have to move to one State ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than another. For Example, an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtic muſt lay aſide the Inclination to move to an Eccleſiaſtical Life; A Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that of perſuading to a Religious State. He muſt be abſolutely diſengag'd in this Conduct, that he may not take his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for the Will of God, much leſs muſt he have any Intereſt, which is a Crime in this Concern.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let him proceed ſeriouſly in this Direction, not giving Counſel in haſt, and in a ſhort time, but taking leiſure to think on it, to Examin all the Reaſons, and all the neceſſary Circumſtances, to ask Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of others if it be convenient, without naming the Perſon concerning whom he Conſults; and above all, to Pray much.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let him have recourſe to God, to know what he muſt counſel him according to his holy Will, and for the Good and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of him whom he Adviſes; and let him put more truſt in his Prayers than his own Judgment, expecting to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by himſelf, but by the ſole Grace of God: For, as the Wiſeman ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">Quis enim hominum ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re poteſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilium Dei, aut quis poterit cogitare quid velit Deus? ſenſum autem tuum quis ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, niſi tu de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deris ſapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, Spiritum ſanctum tuum de altiſſimis? <hi>Sap.</hi> 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Who can know the Deſign of God? or who can know his Will? And who can know his own Thought, except God himſelf give him the knowledge of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:33523:214"/>
                  <p>There happen ſometimes ſo great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in this Choice, that he who gives Counſel, knows not on what to reſolve. Vaſt Obſtacles offer themſelves in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Deſign, and a Man cannot tell whether they be Temptations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which endeavor to divert from it, or Impediments which God ſends, to ſhew that he only deſires the Good-will, and not the Execution of that Deſign; and then there is no other Means to be taken but Time and Prayer.</p>
                  <p>To the Counſel of the Confeſſor may be added that of ſome other Perſons, on Condition they have theſe three Qualities,<note n="*" place="margin">Cum fatuis conſilium ne habeas, non enim potue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt diligere, niſi quae eis placent. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.

                  <head type="sub">Whether Parents are to be hearkned to in this Choice.</head>
                  <p>I Treat this Queſtion here, becauſe it frequently falls out, that the Choice of a State of Life is hinder'd or diſturb'd by Parents, who give not to their Children the liberty of chooſing, but determin them themſelves according to their Inclination or Intereſt; in which Point they ſin moſt

                  <p>Firſt then, <hi>Theotime,</hi> if your Parents leave you at liberty to chooſe your Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you muſt account your ſelf happy, and give God many Thanks for it. Now if they permit not you to have the liberty of chooſing, this is what you muſt do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of an Eccleſiaſtical, or Religious State. 2. In reſpect of a Lay State.</p>
                  <p>As for the Eccleſiaſtical or Religious State, neither their Counſel nor their Will ought to be a ſufficient Reaſon to chooſe, or leave one of theſe Callings; but you muſt conſider whether you be call'd thereto by God. Theſe two States being more perfect, and having greater Obligations than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, require a particular Vocation from God; which ought to be follow'd when it is known, and when it is not, you muſt not engage your ſelf therein. For this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if your Parents deſire that you be an Eccleſiaſtic, or Religious, Firſt Examin, and that a long time, whether God hath call'd you to one of theſe States; and if after you have conſulted a good while, you find no Vocation to either, be careful not to enter upon either, notwithſtanding any Perſuaſions they may uſe, or Commands they may lay upon you, even when they employ Conſtraint and Violence: Yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:33523:215"/>to make this Reſiſtance with all the Reſpect you ow them, ſhewing them modeſtly that you cannot comply with their Deſires, and the Reaſons you have for it. Cauſe theſe Declarations to be made to them by Perſons who have power over their Minds. Beſeech God that he will make them change their Minds, or let you know whether you muſt follow it. If on the contrary, they divert you from an Eccleſiaſtical, or Religious State, and you perceive your ſelf ſtrongly mov'd thereto, you muſt Examin your Inclination, to know whether it come from God; for if God call you, you muſt obey Him, and not Men. You will know whether it come from God, by doing that which we ſhall appoint you hereafter concerning the Choice of theſe two Callings. Chiefly, if your Inclination hath no other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive than to ſerve God,<note place="margin">Marks of a Vocation from God.</note> and procure your Salvation; if it be urgent, long, and perſevering; if it ſtill continue with you amidſt the Obſtacles and Reſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are offer'd, notwithſtanding all the Perſuaſions may be us'd to the contrary; it is a great ſign that it comes from God: Nevertheleſs, act nothing therein without taking Advice from wiſe Perſons, who may counſel you what you have to do; to follow at the ſame time the Inſpiration of God, and not offer an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Reſpect you ow to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p>As to the choice of different Conditions
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:33523:215"/>in the World, ſuppoſing you are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to a Lay State, you muſt conform your ſelf to the Will of your Parents, and yield much to their Inclination and Judgment, except the Condition to which they deſign you, expoſe you to evident Occaſions of offending God, or be notably prejudicial to your Good, or elſe that you have ſuch a repugnance to it, that you cannot conquer it, or a manifeſt unfitneſs, or other great Reaſons; of which yet you alone muſt not judge, but by the Counſel of wiſe and vertuous Perſons.</p>

                     <p>FIRST then, you muſt conſider that you deliberate on a State which is the higheſt, and moſt elevated of all the States in the World. It is the Calling which approaches neareſt to God, and which God hath Eſtabliſh'd to be Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and Men, and by the Mediation whereof he communicates himſelf to them. He hath committed to its Truſt all that is moſt perfect and dear to him; The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of his Word, the Diſpenſation of his Divine Myſteries, the Adminiſtration of his Sacraments, the Government of the Church, and in fine, the Salvation of Souls which he hath Redem'd by the Price of his Blood; A State whoſe Functions ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs all thoſe of Angels, who look upon them with a profound Reſpect, eſteeming them infinitely above their Power, and the Dignity of their Celeſtial Nature. O God, <hi>Theotime,</hi> what a Grandeur and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is this!</p>

                     <p>From theſe two ſo ſtrict obligations ſpring two extream Dangers of this State.<note place="margin">The Dangers of an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal State.</note> The one is, of not being endow'd with the Sanctity it requires, but corrupted by the Spirit and Maxims of the World, and much more by the Contagion of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtics, the greateſt part whereof lead a Life far remov'd from the Perfection of their State. The other Danger is,<note place="margin">Multam mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam docuit otioſitas.</note> of falling into that Idleneſs common to Eccleſiaſtics; which making them neglect the Labor to which their Calling obliges them, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them moſt culpable in the ſight of God, and moreover caſts them into many Diſorders and Vices, whereof it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the Mother.</p>
                     <p>To theſe two Dangers muſt be added two others, which ariſe from Benefices.<note place="margin">Two other Dangers, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and bad uſe of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Goods.</note> The Firſt is, to poſſeſs many Benefices, when one is ſufficient for an honeſt and moderate Maintenance; for that is againſt the Law of God, and of his Church, and againſt all Reaſon. It is the conſtant Opinion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, That that cannot be done without a mortal Sin, except it be by a particular Diſpenſation, built upon good and real Cauſes, which ought to ſpring from the Neceſſity of the Church, or from her greater Advantage. I know very well,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:33523:218"/>that the Covetouſneſs of Incumbents finds ſufficient Means to Diſguiſe themſelves on this Occaſion, under the Pretences of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, Congruity, and even of Piety; but when theſe Pretences ſhall be Examin'd at the Divine Judgment, they will appear what they are, that is, a pure diſguiſing of real Avarice, which will be found moſt criminal in the ſight of God, and cauſe the Damnation of many, who will be ſorry too late for having follow'd the diſorderly Motions of their inſatiable Covetouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>The other Danger conſiſts in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their Revenues, which cannot without a mortal Sin be employ'd in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or even in ſuperfluous Expences, as in Delicacies, in good Chear, in Vanities, in Exceſſes of Feaſts, of Garments, of Mova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and other like things; Not to enrich their Relations, or heap up Treaſures, which often draw the viſible Curſe of God upon thoſe who hoard them up. Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents are forbidden all theſe things. And it is an abſolutely certain Truth, that they cannot receive from their Benefices more than their ſufficient and modeſt Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the reſt ought to be employ'd in Alms and pious Works. Many Divines hold they are bound to Reſtitution, when they diſpoſe of it otherwiſe; and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality condemns them at leaſt of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin.</p>

                     <p>There muſt then be a Vocation to an Eccleſiaſtical State, and this ſole Example of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ought to confound all thoſe who have the boldneſs to intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their own Motion, without a Divine Call, drawing upon themſelves by this Impudence, the Wrath of Almighty God, the refuſal of his Favors, and the certain loſs of their Eternal Salvation.</p>

                     <p>To know whether this Motion come from God, you muſt Examin two things. 1. What Intention inclines you to this State. 2. Whether you have the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Diſpoſitions.</p>
                     <p>As to the Intention, if it be bad, 'tis certain your Motion comes not from God; for he cannot be the Author of any Ill.

                     <p>It is not ſufficient for the Eccleſiaſtical State, to have a good Intention, you muſt beſides be fit for it.

<pb n="420" facs="tcp:33523:220"/>Canons of the Church, of being admitted to Orders. The Defects of the Mind are Dullneſs or Stupidity, Rudeneſs, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, Ignorance, and other like, which viſibly render a Man incapable of diſcharging Eccleſiaſtical Duties. Such Defects, when they cannot be conceal'd by Age, and Labor, are contrary to an Eccleſiaſtical Calling, and apparently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that a Man is not call'd to it.</p>
                     <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Manners.

                  <head>CHAP. X.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of a Religious State.</head>
                  <p>AFTER the Eccleſiaſtical State I come to the Religious, the Choice whereof is of no leſs Conſequence than that of the former, nor ſubject to leſs Faults.</p>
                  <p>It is an excellent thing that a Religious, who having once forſaken all things, ſhould have no other care than to pleaſe God by the practice of Penance and Humility, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the exact obſervance of his Rule, and keeping himſelf retir'd from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the World, that he may addict himſelf entirely to the Study of real and ſolid Perfection.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary, it is a ſad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable thing, that a Religious, who is only religious in Habit, and making a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Profeſſion of Perfection, is farther from it than the moſt imperfect Layman; loving the World, and worldly things, ſubject even to the moſt groſs Vices; or having overcome corporal Vices, as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, Gluttony, and the like, permits himſelf to be carry'd away by ſpiritual Sins, as Anger, Ambition, Envy, Diſcord, Enmity, and other like, which are by ſo much more dangerous, as they are leſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. I omit to ſpeak of thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enter'd too eaſily into Religion, and without a Vocation from God, repent
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:33523:225"/>themſelves afterwards, for being too lightly engag'd in a Buſineſs of ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. A Repentance which frequently caſts them into great Diſorders, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times carries them even to Apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p>To make a good Choice of this State,<note place="margin">Two things to be conſider'd in a Religious Life.</note> two things are neceſſary, 1. To know it well; that is to ſay, to underſtand what it is, its Obligations, its Advantages, and its Dangers. 2. To be Inſtructed well in in the Means he muſt make uſe of to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate on it, and to know whether he be call'd to it. This is what we ſhall Treat of in the three following Articles.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A Religious Life</hi> (according to S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>) <hi>is a Means inſtituted to acquire Sanctity.</hi>

Thom.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Quaeſt.</hi> 189. <hi>Art.</hi> 1.</note> Not an exterior Sanctity, which appears in the Habit, and exterior Actions of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in an interior Holineſs, which conſiſts in the Sanctification of the Soul; which is effected by the mortification of the Paſſions, by the abridgment of diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paſſions, by the ſtripping her ſelf from all Inclination to Creatures and Self-love, by a ſtrict Union with God thro' Charity. For this End do they leave the World, that with leſs hindrance, and more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom they may apply themſelves to theſe Exerciſes. For this do they renounce all worldly Goods and Contentments, not
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:33523:225"/>only in Affection, as all Chriſtians are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to renounce them; but alſo in Effect, that they may more freely and perfectly give themſelves to God. And Laſtly, To acquire this interior Sanctity, they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Auſterities, Obediences, and all the Rules of Religion, which are made only for that End.</p>
                     <p>The Obligations of this kind of Life are great;<note place="margin">Its Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> for it obliges to obſerve an exact Chaſtity, a perfect Poverty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd not only from the Poſſeſſion of any Goods, but from all Affection to earthly things, with an entire renunciation of their proper Will to follow that of their Superiors, and to ſanctifie themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly by the practice of Chriſtian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, of which we have already ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>As the Obligations of this State are ſtrict, there are alſo ſingular Advantages,<note place="margin">Its Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> which<note n="*" place="margin">Quae eſt iſta tam precioſa margarita, nonne haec Religio ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, pura &amp; immaculata, in qua homo vivit purius, cadit rarius, ſurgit veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, incedit cautius, irro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, quieſcit ſecurius, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur fiducius, purgatur citius, praemiatur copioſius? <hi>S.

                        </note> S. <hi>Bernard</hi> handles in one of his Sermons, where he ſays, That <hi>in Religion a Man lives more purely, is rais'd more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, walks more cautiouſly, is more frequently bedew'd with Divine Grace, repoſes with more ſecurity, dies with leſs fear, is ſooner purg'd in the other Life, and more abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd in Heaven.</hi> But this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as he himſelf ſays, of a holy, pure, and immaculate Religion, that is, a Religion obſerv'd holily, wherein they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor ſolidly for interior Sanctity, as has been ſaid.</p>
                     <pb n="432" facs="tcp:33523:226"/>
                     <p>This State hath no ſmall Dangers as well as great Advantages;<note place="margin">Its Dangers.</note> the ſame<note n="*" place="margin">Recta qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſemita veſtra &amp; ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior conjugatorum vita, non tamen omnino ſecura. Timendum enim periculum triplex, id eſt, ne forte aequare ſe alteri, aut re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicere retro, aut certe in medio ponte ſtare, ſeu reſidere quis velit. <hi>S. Bern. de tribus ordinibus.</hi>
                        </note> S. <hi>Bernard</hi> reduces them to three.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Danger is of falling into Pride, and a good Opinion of ones ſelf, which creeps ſo eaſily and inſenſibly into pious Actions, whoſe merit it greatly diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and many times abſolutely ruins.</p>
                     <p>The Second is the Danger of looking back to return unto the World, either in Effect, or by Affection and Deſire.</p>
                     <p>The Third is of growing looſe in the Exerciſe of a Religious life. It is a Way, as the ſame Saint ſays, wherein one muſt neceſſarily either advance, or retire; and if a Man grows ſlack, he falls into Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which makes him in the Habit of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Piety lead a moſt ſecular Life, and full of Vices, and which is by ſo much more dangerous, as being really wicked, it bears the appearance of Vertue.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe Dangers ordinarily ſprings from this, that Men judge of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity by the Exterior, and one eſteems him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch as he ſeems in appearance, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding that Sanctity conſiſts in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Soul, and chiefly in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of a ſolid, and perfect Humility. The Second and Third ariſe moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from converſing with the World,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:33523:226"/>which is infinitely dangerous for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons, as<note n="*" place="margin">Neceſſe eſt ut quiſque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioſus ſi fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari deſiderat, ſaeculum contemnat, &amp; ſeſe intra monaſterii clauſtra concludat. <hi>S. Bern. lib. debene vivend. Serm.</hi> 66.</note> S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſays, and all three together proceed from the want of a true Vocation to Religion.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, <hi>Theotime,</hi> are the principal things you ought to conſider, if you deliberate on a Religious Calling: Now to the end you may proceed with more aſſurance in this Deliberation, I ſhall tell you the Order, you muſt obſerve therein, and what you muſt do to know whether you be call'd to it.</p>

                     <head type="sub">What is to be done to know whether one be call'd to Religion.</head>
                     <p>Firſt, If you perceive in your ſelf a ſtrong Motion to that State, have a care not to reject it, becauſe perhaps it is a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from God; nor alſo to embrace it ſuddenly, being it may be only a human Motion. You muſt examin whether it be God who ſpeaks interiorly to you; for if it be, you muſt hear and follow him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he calls you; if it be not, you muſt remain as you are.</p>
                     <p>But how ſhould I know that? you'll ſay: See the Means. Take a good ſpace of time to apply your ſelf to this important Affair, and during that time practiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly four things.</p>
                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:33523:227"/>
                     <p n="1">1. Refrain from any Converſation with thoſe who would move or excite you to be Religious. The Reaſon is very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; for as ſoon as you ſhall be ſolicited to it, you will not know how to diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Inclination you have to it comes from the Inſpiration of God, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of Men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beg daily of God with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, that he would be pleas'd to make his Will known to you, and confirm you in this Motion if it come from him, or take it away if it come not from him. Say to him as S. <hi>Peter</hi> did,<note n="a" place="margin">Domine, ſi tu es, jube me venire ad te. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord, if it be thou who ſpeakeſt, command me to come to thee.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that you are ready to hearken to him as young <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Loquere Domine, quia audit ſervus tuus. 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Speak, Lord, for thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hears thee;</hi> and ſay with S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Domine, quid me vis facere? <hi>Act</hi> 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me do?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Examin diligently, 1. The Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Advantages, and Dangers of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life, of which we have ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. 2. The Intention you bring to this State.<note place="margin">The Intention that muſt be had to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Religion.</note> The Intention which muſt be had in this Deſign, is to withdraw your ſelf from the World to do Penance, and to be ſanctifi'd interiorly by the practice of Chriſtian Vertues. See whether this be your Motive; think often on it ſeriouſly without flattering your ſelf; for if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive incline you to that Calling, your Deſign is not from God. Examin alſo whether you be fit for it, and whether you have nothing that is incompatible with that Condition, be it in Body or Mind.
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:33523:227"/>Corporal Infirmities, and bad Qualities of the Mind; but chiefly all Lightneſs and Inconſtancy render a Man unapt for that Calling.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Above all things reſolve not on your own Head, and without taking good Counſel. It is a very common Fault a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt young People, many whereof put themſelves into Religion without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Counſel than that of their own Mind, which frequently they admit there too eaſily: From whence it often falls out, that they are oblig'd to go out, or having a ſhame to change, they badly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Vocation engage themſelves therein. Act not ſo, <hi>Theotime,</hi> but declare your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſome prudent Perſon, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to your Ghoſtly Father; and if you have not an ordinary one, chooſe avertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, diſcreet, and underſtanding one; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all your interior Thoughts to him, and hearken humbly to his Advice.</p>
                     <p>When you have done thus for a good ſpace of time, that is, at leaſt for ſix Months, or a Year; If the Intention you have to be Religious, continue ſtill, and your Intention alſo be ſuch as it ought to be, that is, pure and holy, and that you have convenient Diſpoſitions of Mind and Body for that State, you have reaſon to believe that your Inſpiration comes from God, and that he calls you to Religion; But if this Inclination continues not, it is a ſign that it was only a human Motion.</p>
                     <p>Some may ſay that you ought readily
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:33523:228"/>to put in Execution the Inſpirations from God, and that to delay the Performance a long time, is to put ones ſelf in danger of loſing them, according to that Maxim of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Neſcit tarda molimina Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus ſancti gratia.</note> which ſays, <hi>That the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt approves not of ſlow En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, That it is true when you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently know that the Inſpiration comes from God; but before you can have that knowledge, you not only do well to defer it, but you ought to delay, principally in Affairs of conſequence. Now to come to this knowledge you muſt have time: And in a word, to do what we have ſaid, is not to be wanting to our Fidelity, and Truſt in the Grace of God, but to practiſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Maxim of the Holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who commands us <hi>Not to believe every Spirit, but to try whether they come from God.</hi> This is not to put ones ſelf in danger of loſing ones Vocation, but to comply with ones Duty, to know the truth of it by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Marks, the beſt whereof is, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to embrace it more zealouſly, and to execute it with more fidelity. In fine, that you may be more convinc'd of this Maxim againſt the Oppoſitions you may find therein, I ſhall add to it another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Article.</p>

                     <p>If God gave us always certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Marks of his Inſpiration for great Enterpriſes, queſtionleſs we ſhould not take time to deliberate on them, nor to put them in Execution; but becauſe he is not pleas'd ordinarily to deal with us in this manner, and admoniſheth us by the Apoſtle,<note n="a" place="margin">Nolite omni Spiritui cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere; ſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Spiritus ſi ex Deo ſint. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.</note>

                        <hi>the Spirit of Darkneſs frequently transforms himſelf into an Angel of Light:</hi> There is no queſtion but that it is ſo far from being a bad Action to defer in this Occaſion, that it is a thing abſolutely neceſſary and conformable to the Order eſtabliſh'd by God, who would have us make uſe of Means proper to know his Will, and of the Signs he hath given us, to diſcern the Inſpirations which come from his Grace, from thoſe which come not.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Means are the three we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given you above, a good Life, Prayer, and Counſel. A good Life takes away the greateſt Obſtacle to the Grace of God, which is Sin, and makes us moſt worthy of his Lights. Prayer, when it is humble, fervent, and perſeverant, makes us obtain them. And good Counſel ſerves to direct
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:33523:229"/>us to know the Will of God, and not take our own Inclination for a Divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>When our Lord had touch'd <hi>Paul,</hi> and brought him to demand what he would have him do, he ſends him to <hi>Ananias</hi> to learn his Will from him. This holy Man inſpir'd by God, comes to ſeek this new Convert, who was at Prayer, and declar'd to him on the part of God what he would have him do. This is a Model of what you ought to do in this ſo important an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                     <p>Permit yourſelf to be mov'd by God for your Converſion, and look upon it as your principal End; Beg of him to know what his Will is, that you ſhould perform, to do Penance: Pray inceſſantly for this intent, and go to take Counſel, to learn there what you muſt do.</p>
                     <p>As for the Marks of a Vocation, there are alſo three, which are, Humility, Quiet of Mind, and Perſeverance. By Humility, I underſtand that Vertue which makes us wholly diſtruſt our own Judgment in an Affair of ſuch importance, to follow that of the more wiſe. By Quiet of Mind, I mean a Diſpoſition to follow the Will of God, on whatſoever ſide it may incline, when we ſhall ſufficiently know it. By Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, I underſtand the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an Inſpiration, amidſt the Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Difficulties which occur.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the three moſt ordinary Marks by which the Spirit of God makes
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:33523:229"/>himſelf known to us; and if any of thoſe be wanting, you have reaſon to doubt of your Vocation; as on the contrary, if you have them all together, you have good cauſe to believe that God calls you. If ſome ſay to you, that there is no need of Deliberating ſo exactly about entring into Religion, becauſe there is a Year of Noviceſhip, to try their Vocation by the Marks and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices we have ſpoken of. I anſwer, That this would be true, if it were as eaſie to go out of Religion, as to enter into it; and if this going out did not draw after it ſo many bad Conſequences as ordinarily it doth. But becauſe it frequently happens, that thoſe who are enter'd into Religion, are kept there by the fear of being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inconſtant, or for ſome other human Conſideration, which makes them engage themſelves in that State badly, and without a Vocation; or chancing to depart from Religion, are look'd upon by the World as Inconſtant, contemn'd as People fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and what is yet worſe, it happens, often, that leaving the Religious Habit, they alſo forſake Vertue, and lead a Life very different from what they had begun in Religion. For all theſe Reaſons I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſay, that a Man muſt Examin the Vocation before he enters into Religion; and for this intent take all the time that ſhall be neceſſary to be morally aſſur'd of it.</p>
                     <p>Act ſo then, <hi>Theotime,</hi> if you perceive your ſelf mov'd to Religion, and be not
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:33523:230"/>afraid of loſing your Vocation, if you put it not ſuddenly in Execution; for if you practiſe faithfully what we have ſaid, with a ſincere Intention to know the Will of God, you will not fail in the Reſolution you ſhall take; God will conduct you in that Deliberation to the State he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for you; and if he call you to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he will confirm you in that Deſire by the Perſeverance he will give you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in you the good Work he ſhall have begun, according to that Expreſſion of S. <hi>Paul, Qui caepit in vos opus bonum, perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciet, confirmabit, ſolidabitque.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all, when you reſolve to embrace a Religious Life, remember to prefer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Religious, thoſe where a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Life is moſt exactly obſerv'd, and where they ſolidly labor to gain Piety, and as much as you can, where there is leaſt Communication with the World.</p>

                  <p>AS the Life of Eccleſiaſtics and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious has its Dangers, the Secular Life hath alſo its Perils, which are not ſmall; he who deliberates on it, ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to foreſee them: And theſe Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are different, according to the divers States of that Life. Wherefore I Treat here of the principal Callings of a Secular

                     <p>If there be a difficult and dangerous Condition in the World,<note place="margin">Maxims to be obſerv'd by thoſe who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern others.</note> it is the Office of thoſe who are call'd to Govern others; as Kings and Princes, who have Sovereign Authority; Lords of particular Places, who have an inferior Authority; Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Publick Officers, who have an aſſign'd Authority committed to them by the Prince. If then by your Condition, or for any other Cauſe, you ſee your ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for a State of Government, you ought to arm your ſelf againſt the great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and innumerable Dangers of that State, with wholſom Chriſtian Maxims, whereof theſe are the principal, which I beſeech you read attentively.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Have a care of giving acceſs to the thoughts of Pride or Preſumption, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf rais'd above others: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that by how much higher you are rais'd, by ſo much more have you reaſon to fear, according to that Maxim of the Scripture,<note n="a" place="margin">Quanto major es, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia te in omnibus. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.</note>

                     <p n="2">2. Conſider not your State as a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but as a weighty Charge; nor as a thing given you for your good, but for the benefit of others. Know, that thoſe whom you Command, are not made for you, but you for them: They ow Reſpect and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to you, and you ow to them things that are far more difficult, that is, Care, Aſſiſtance, Conſervation, and Juſtice.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Believe firmly, that how great Power ſoever you have, you hold it from God, and that you are his Miniſter and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for the Government of Men, and by conſequence, that you ought to Govern according to his Will, and ſhall give him an exact Account of your Conduct.</p>

                     <p>You are oblig'd to it by the Rank you bear, for you hold the place of God; you ought to imitate his Sanctity, as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his Perſon in Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>You are alſo oblig'd to it for the benefit of your Inferiors, who cannot but be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable when they are Govern'd by a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man.<note n="a" place="margin">In multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione juſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum laetabitur vulgus; cum impii ſumpſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum gemet populus. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>For this reaſon in the ancient Law, God had commanded that the King, and it ought to be underſtood of all thoſe who Command, ſhould always have with him the Book of the Law, and ſhould read it daily,<note n="b" place="margin">Ut diſcat timere Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Deum ſuum, &amp; cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire verba &amp; ceremonias ejus quae in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge praecepta ſunt. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.</note>

                     <p>Moreover, your Example will much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence your Superiors; if you be good, they will imitate your Vertue; if you be vicious, they will take all liberty to be wicked, according to the Maxim of the Wiſeman,<note n="c" place="margin">Secundum judicem po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli ſic &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtri ejus.

                     <p>Call to mind the Hiſtory of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael:</hi>

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:33523:232"/>his Power, but alſo his Wiſdom, his Goodneſs, and his Juſtice, you muſt alſo exerciſe your Authority with theſe Qualities, performing nothing but with much Wiſdom, treating your Inferiors with a Fatherly Goodneſs, and giving Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to every one.<note n="*" place="margin">Leo rapiens, &amp; Urſus eſuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, Princeps impius ſuper populum ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.</note> Authority exercis'd without Wiſdom is a Brutiſhneſs, without Goodneſs is a Tyranny, and without Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is a Robbing.</p>

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:33523:233"/>It is a grievous Evil amongſt the Great ones, that Little ones cannot approach to them, to have recourſe to their Juſtice, as the Scripture it ſelf complains,<note n="*" place="margin">Pupillo non judicant, &amp; cauſa viduae non ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad illos. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.</note>

                     <p>The Firſt is out of the Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,<note place="margin">A conſiderable Advertiſement.</note> in the Sixth Chapter of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> wherein is contain'd this terrible Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, which the Holy Ghoſt gives to Great ones,<note n="*" place="margin">Audite er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Reges &amp; intelligite, diſcite judices finium terrae.

Becauſe being Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his Kingdom, you have not judged aright, nor obſerved the Law, nor walked after the Will of God, horribly and ſuddenly will he appear unto you; for a hard Judgment ſhall they have who bear Rule.

Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vertues are eaſily there corrupted, the moſt ſolid are there ſhaken, and it is very difficult not to be deſtroy'd in it. It is a Life wherein Pride, Ambition, Vanity, Idleneſs, Exceſs, Intemperance, a diſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love of Pleaſures, an inſatiable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs of the Goods of the World do apparently reign. If there be any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is only in ſhew and hypocriſie; every one makes ſo much appear as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to arrive at his End. Solid Vertue is there contemn'd, mock'd, and many times perſecuted. An inſatiable deſire of growing Great poſſeſſes the Minds of all. Every one thinks of nothing but his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Fortune. From thence ſpring the Flattering of Great ones, a looſe Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence towards all the World, unworthy Submiſſion, falſe Friendſhips, Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhews a pleaſing Countenance to thoſe whom they hate in their Heart. From thence Envies, Cozening, Cheats, malicious Intrigues, unjuſt Means to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant others, and to advance themſelves at their Expence. From thence irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enmities, Revenge, and many dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Accidents take their riſe.</p>
                     <p>If things be ſo, how can one be Sav'd in this Condition, you'll ſay? And what muſt they do who ſee themſelves deſtinated for that State?

See here what you muſt bring with you, if any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or Birth, or any Office deſign you for that State.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt Precaution is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> Precaution.</note> to bring thither a Mind fully convinc'd of the Vanity of Earthly things, of Greatneſs, of Riches, of Pleaſures; all theſe things paſs, and you ſhall paſs with them, but Eternity ſhall never paſs.</p>

O what an admirable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is that, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to gain Heaven.</p>

                     <p n="1">1.

Arm your ſelf againſt the tyranny of Duels, by a firm Reſolution never to Fight a Duel; a Reſolution, without which you can never be in the State of Grace, but in a perpetual State of mortal Sin and Damnation. Ought not this ſole Thought to raiſe in you a horror for Duels? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' you perform all the Good imaginable, altho' you lead a Life as holy as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Saints, except you have this Reſolution of not Fighting a Duel, you are not in the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:33523:241"/>State of Salvation: All your Confeſſions are Sacrileges and Abominations in the ſight of God, becauſe you ſtill continue in a Will to offend him mortally: Even that which you ſhall make at the hour of Death, if you have time to make it, will avail you nothing; for never having had this Reſolution during your whole Life, it is almoſt impoſſible you ſhould have a true and ſincere one at the hour of your Death.</p>
                     <p>I could bring you here many powerful Reaſons againſt this madneſs of Duels.<note place="margin">Divers Reaſons againſt Duels.</note> A Duel is not an Action of Courage; Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage conſiſts in expoſing ones Life for the Publick Good, in defending ones ſelf when he is aſſaulted: Now in a Duel you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your Life without neceſſity, for a Diſpleaſure, for a Revenge, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to no Man; oftentimes for pure Folly and Childiſhneſs, ſometimes to pleaſe another, who requeſts that Service of you, that is, to ſacrifice your Life, and damn your Soul for his Quarrel. Now you expoſe therein your Life, which is not yours, but belongs to God, and the Publick. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which is pretended to be forfeited by avoiding or refuſing a Duel, is an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Honor, there being none but worldly and wicked Perſons who condemn this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, which is prais'd and approv'd by wiſe and good People. All diſcreet Men deteſt Duels, and none but the wicked ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them. The Law puniſhes them as Enemies of the Publick Good. Your Prince,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:33523:241"/>to whom you ow Obedience, forbids them. The Church deteſts and condemns them; She Excommunicates all thoſe who Fight Duels, or contribute any thing to them; She deprives of Eccleſiaſtical Burying, all thoſe who die in that Combat.</p>
                     <p>Without ſtopping to Treat at large theſe moſt powerful Reaſons, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf to make you conſider two things. 1.<note place="margin">Two ſtrong Reaſons againſt Duels.</note> That a Duel is a Crime in the ſight of God. 2. That it is incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with your Salvation.</p>
                     <p>It is a Crime as great, as Homicide or Murther is great and enormous. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how Homicide or Murther is deteſted by God: It is a Crime which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Image of God, and the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of his Hands; God hath ſuch a horror for it, that he would not have him pardon'd who is guilty of it.<note n="a" place="margin">Quicunque effuderit hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur ſanguis illius, ad ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem quippe Dei factus eſt homo. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.</note>

                        </note> Beaſts, which had taken away Man's Life, to manifeſt what a horror he had for Murther. By this, judge of the quality of a Duel, by which you go to ſpill the Blood of your Brother, deſtroy the Image of God, and what is yet more horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ruin for ever the Soul of your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or your own, for each of which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath dy'd: Or if you arrive not at theſe Misfortunes, you expoſe your ſelf to evident danger of falling into them, and ſo you are as criminal in the ſight of God
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:33523:242"/>as if the Effect ſucceeded. Conſider that this Blood which you ſhall have ſhed,<note n="a" place="margin">Vox ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis fratris tui clamat ad me de terra. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.</note> will cry to God for Vengeance againſt you, as that of <hi>Abel</hi> againſt <hi>Cain;</hi>

                     <p>From hence follows the Second Truth which I have propos'd to you, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Duel is incompatible with Salvation. Where by a Duel I underſtand not the actual Fighting, but the Will of Duelling; becauſe the Will to commit a Crime, is directly oppoſite to Salvation. You muſt then either renounce Duels, or your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; Conſider which you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. This is very difficult, you'll ſay: 'Tis true, but it is neceſſary. It is difficult principally in the Corruption of the Times; but your Salvation is concern'd. It is hard in the beginning, but in time, and by the Grace of God, it becomes eaſie. In a word, <hi>Theotime,</hi> you will conquer the Difficulties, if you will apply your ſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to it, and make uſe of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Means.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Demand of God the Grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce from your Heart that tyranny, and never to yield to it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Be convinc'd of the nature of a Duel,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:33523:242"/>that a Duel is a wicked Action, baſe and impertinent, forbidden by God,<note place="margin">Deteſtabilis duellorum u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, fabrican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te diabolo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductus; ut cruenta cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum morte animarum etiam perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem lucretur, ex orbe penitus exterminetur. <hi>Conc.

                     <p n="3">3. Call to mind thoſe of your Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance who are dead in Duels, and loſt for ever: Judge what Apprehenſions they have now of Duels, and what Renunciations they would make of them, if they could return into the World; but there is no more time for them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When any one ſhall Challenge you, anſwer him aloud, That you will not Fight, a Duel being forbidden both by Divine and Human Laws. If any one accuſe you of Cowardiſe, tell him, That you know well how to ſhew your Courage in good Occaſions, for the Service of your Prince and Country. If he threaten to aſſault you whereſoever he ſhall find you, anſwer, That you will defend your ſelf, but make no Appointment either directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, ſaying, I paſs by ſuch a Place, or the like. If after this he attack you, defend your ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Avoid the Cauſes of Duels, as Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Enmities. Offend no Perſon; or if by Imprudence, or otherwiſe, you wrong
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:33523:243"/>any one, give him Satisfaction, and declare you had no intention to offend him. This is what concerns Duels.</p>
                     <p>As for what remains towards the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating your Life, be no Swearer, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer as others.

I add the Dangers of Chaſtity, to which they are often expos'd, by reaſon of the neceſſity they have of treating with Objects which may excite Impurity, which is a Reaſon why they ſhould have a great Precaution againſt this Vice.</p>
                     <p>Merchants ought to avoid Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the exceſſive deſire of Gain or Riches, which totally poſſeſſes their Mind, Deceits, diſguiſing or falſifying Merchandizes, breaking their Word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and exceſſive Gain, Uſury and other Diſorders.

I ſpoke nothing of theſe States in the firſt Impreſſions of this Book, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I made reffection of it, when I review'd it for this Edition, I conceiv'd it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſpeak to you of them, and give you ſome neceſſary Advices, to make you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a great number of moſt important Faults which Men are accuſtom'd to fall into, in the choice of theſe two States, which draw after them an infinite number of Miſeries, and frequently Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. To perform this profitably I ſhall follow the Method I have already obſerv'd for the Eccleſiaſtical and Religious State. I ſhall Treat of two things concerning theſe two States. 1. What we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider to know them well. 2. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:33523:245"/>we muſt bring to enter well into that State, and acquit our Selves wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily in it.</p>

                     <head type="sub">What we muſt know of a Marry'd Life.</head>
                     <p>There are four things to be known of this State, its Holineſs, its Obligations, its Advantages, and its Dangers.</p>
                     <p>I ſay Firſt, that this State is Holy, it having been Inſtituted and Sanctifi'd by God himſelf from the beginning of the World, and ſince rais'd to the Dignity of a Sacrament by his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to ſanctifie the Perſons that would enter into it, and to confer on them Graces neceſſary to acquit themſelves worthily of it. Thus this State is Holy every way, by its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who is God, by the Dignity of the Sacrament which is annexed to it, by the ſanctifying Grace which it augments in thoſe who duly receive it, by the Favors and Aſſiſtances it affords them in their Neceſſities; and in fine, by the excellent Signification of the Union of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with the Church his Spouſe, which made S. <hi>Paul</hi> give it the Name of a<note n="*" place="margin">Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum hoc mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt, ego autem dico in Chriſto &amp; in Eccleſia. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.</note> great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Holineſs of this State brings with it great Obligations, whereof the Firſt is, to enter into it Holily, that is, with the requiſite Diſpoſitions, which we ſhall ſpeak of hereafter. The Second is,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:33523:246"/>to lead to holy and truly Chriſtian Life, in the Fear of God, and in the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Commandments, as it is ſaid of the<note n="*" place="margin">Erant au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem juſti am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo ante De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um inceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus mandatis, &amp; juſtificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ſine quere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. <hi>Luc.</hi> 1.</note> Father and Mother of S. <hi>John;</hi> to obſerve an inviolable Fidelity to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, to uſe moderately lawful Pleaſures, and to refrain from thoſe that are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to Educate their Children in the Fear of God, provide for their Neceſſities, to have a care of their Temporal Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and much more of their Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Advantages of this State for Salvation are not ſo great as thoſe of the Eccleſiaſtical or Religious Life; It is alſo true, that it requires not ſo high a Perfection: And if there be any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage above thoſe two States, it is, that not obliging to ſuch ſtrict things, it leaves a greater facility for Salvation, when there occur not other Obſtacles beſides. As for the Temporal Advantages, I place them not here to be conſider'd, becauſe we look upon this State here only in reference to Salvation. Moreover, the Pleaſures and Contentments that are found therein, are not comparable to the Troubles and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities with which it is repleniſh'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Expreſſion of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſays, that Afflictions are inevitable to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd Perſons, <hi>Tribulationes carnis habebunt hujuſmodi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Dangers of this State are great in number, and they are by ſo much greater, as they are not diſcover'd,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:33523:246"/>nor often perceiv'd by thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd with them.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt ſprings from the exceſſive and unreaſonable Love that is frequently found between Marry'd Perſons, which is the cauſe of a vaſt number of Sins they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit by a criminal Complacence, which makes them fear more to diſpleaſe their Conſort than offend God, and draw upon them his Diſpleaſure and Indignation.</p>
                     <p>The Second Danger ariſes from a Cauſe quite contrary to the former, which is an Averſion they ſometimes have for one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, proceeding from the contrariety of Humors, Jealouſies, or other like Cauſes. An Averſion which draws after it a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual train of Sins, and an abyſs of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                     <p>The Third Danger comes from the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Love they have for their Children, which is alſo an unexhauſtible Source of Sins to Parents, when thro' that fooliſh Love they apply all their Care for the Temporal Advantages of their Children, as Health, Beauty, good Behavior, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them in the World, to heap up Riches for them, which will only ſerve to deſtroy them, to procure great Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for them, and in the mean time neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their Education, their Correction, their Amendment, their good Life, and their Eternal Salvation.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Danger is that of Loving the World too much, and engaging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too deeply in the Affection of the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:33523:247"/>Goods and Pleaſures of this Life: An Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which makes them loſe the taſt and ſenſe of real Goods, which are thoſe of Grace and Eternal Salvation. This made S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Qui cum uxore eſt, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitus eſt quae ſunt mundi, quomodo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat uxori, &amp; diviſus eſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> That <hi>he who is Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd is perplex'd with the Affairs of the World, and his Spirit is divided between God and the World.</hi> All theſe Dangers are greater than can be expreſt, and Marry'd Perſons have need of much Grace to avoid them.</p>

                     <head>ARTICLE II.</head>
                     <head type="sub">The neceſſary Diſpoſitions for a Marry'd State.</head>
                     <p>We may ſay with truth, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Miſeries which happen in a Marry'd Life, ſprings from the bad Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions they bring with them, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the following.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, the bad Life of young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their Youth, and chiefly after they have finiſh'd their Studies, until the time of their Marriage: For if, as the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſays, God will give a happy Marriage to thoſe who have liv'd piouſly during their Youth, it follows manifeſtly, that he frequently puniſheth the Sins of Youth by an unfortunate Marriage, as we daily ſee.</p>
                     <p>The Second Fault is, the bad Intention of thoſe who enter into the State of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; who propoſe to themſelves no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End in that State than Pleaſure, and the Contents they expect to find therein,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:33523:247"/>and which they conceive to be quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what in effect they are.</p>
                     <p>The Third is that which is committed in the choice of the Perſon they have a mind to Eſpouſe: A Choice which is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily made without conſulting God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any knowledge of the Diſpoſition, Manners, or Humor of the Perſon with whom they are to be Engag'd for their whole Life, and without any other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration than that of Intereſt, or frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by an indiſcreet and ill-grounded Love. This is the Complaint of S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who ſays it often happens, that there is no<note n="*" place="margin">Pleriſque nulla eſt uxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris electio, ſed qualis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venerit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benda, ſi fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua, ſi ambitioſa, quodcunque vitii eſt, poſt nu-ptias diſcimus.</note> Choice made in Marriages, and that the Faults of the Women are not known till after they are Eſpouſed.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Cauſe ſprings from the bad Diſpoſition they bring to the Sacrament of Matrimony,<note place="margin">Filii ſancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſumus, &amp; non poſtumus ita conjungi ſicut Gentes quae ignorant Deum. <hi>Tob.</hi> 8.</note> which they often receive in a wicked State; and from all the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that are committed in the Celebration of the Nuptials, as well by the Marry'd as by thoſe who are invited: For, how can God give his Benediction to a Marriage wherein the Parties bring a Heart full of lewd Thoughts, and unchaſt Deſires; where they make Expences of Garments and Feaſts, which offend Chriſtian Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and frequently exceed their State and Ability, and where all things paſs in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencious freedom of ſaying and doing any thing? So that theſe Nuptials are rather
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:33523:248"/>the Triumph of impure Love, and a Feaſt of the Devil, than a Marriage of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which ought to be conſecrated to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and ſanctifi'd by the Preſence of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are the the moſt ordinary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of bad Marriages, and of all the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Misfortunes which ariſe from thence. From whence it follows, that the firſt Means to ſucceed well in ſo great and important an Enterpriſe, is carefully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all theſe ſo dreadful Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>To perform this with ſucceſs, this is what you ſhall do. You muſt be convinc'd of three Truths, which are certain and undoubted Maxims in this matter.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, That the greateſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that can befall him who embraces a Marry'd Life, is to ſucceed well in the choice of the Perſon he would Eſpouſe; as on the contrary, there is no greater Misfortune than to proſper ill in this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. The Second is, That this good ſucceſs can only come from God. And the Third, That God doth not ordinarily ſhew this Favor but to thoſe who have liv'd well, or have done Penance, and have not fall'n into the Faults we have pointed at.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three Truths are expreſs'd by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf; he teaches the Firſt, when he ſays by the Mouth of the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note n="a" place="margin">Qui invenit mulierem bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, invenit bonum, &amp; hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet ſalutem à domino. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. Mulieris bonae beatus vir. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 26.</note> 
                        <hi>That he who hath found a good Wife, hath found a great Bleſſing; for a good Wife makes her Husband happy;</hi> That <hi>it is a Bleſſing which ſurpaſſes all Bleſſings;</hi> That
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:33523:248"/>
                        <hi>there is nothing which can be compar'd to a vertuous Wife.</hi> And on the contrary he ſaith, That<note n="b" place="margin">Qui tenet mulierem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam quaſi qui apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſcorpio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> 
                        <hi>he who hath met with a wicked Wife, is like him who hath taken up a Scorpion in his Hand;</hi> And that<note n="c" place="margin">Commorari leoni &amp; dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coni placebit quam habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re cum mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re nequam. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 25.</note> 
                        <hi>the Company of a Lion or Serpent is more ſupportable than that of a bad Wife.</hi> The Second Truth is expreſs'd by theſe excellent Words, That<note n="d" place="margin">Datum Dei eſt mulier ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſata &amp; tacita, non eſt immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae animae. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 26.</note> 
                        <hi>a prudent and diſcreet Wife is the Gift of God,</hi> to which there is nothing comparable. And in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> That<note n="e" place="margin">Domus &amp; divitiae dantur à parentibus, à Domino autem proprie uxor prudens. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Parents may well give a Houſe and Riches to their Children, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains only to God to give a diſcreet Wife.</hi> The Third Truth is a conſequence of the Second; for if God gives this great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, it follows alſo, that a Man muſt merit it from him, as he himſelf hath declar'd by the ſame Wiſeman, who ſays,<note n="f" place="bottom">Pars bona mulier bona, in parte timentium Deum dabitur viro pro factio bonis. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 26.</note> 
                        <hi>A Man is happy when he finds a good Wife,</hi> and that <hi>it is the Portion of thoſe who fear God;</hi> and that God gives it to Man in recompence of his good Actions.</p>
                     <p>And the Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> ſays to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of young <hi>Sara,</hi> that his Daughter was reſerv'd for young <hi>Toby,</hi> becauſe he fear'd God, and that the others had been <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of her by reaſon of their Sins.</hi> Huic <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti Deum debetur conjux filia tua, propte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea alius non potuit habere eam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second thing you ſhall have to do when you ſhall be fully convinc'd of theſe
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:33523:249"/>Truths, is to concern your ſelf to avoid the four Faults we mention'd, which are the moſt ordinary Cauſes of bad Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and by avoiding them to practiſe the contrary Actions, which are the neceſſary Diſpoſitions for Marriage.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, Live well during your Youth. Be Chaſt, and let not the love of Pleaſures take poſſeſſion of your Heart. Follow not the Torrent of the bad Example of thoſe of your Age, who gape after nothing but Pleaſures. Be afraid, leſt God puniſh you by the ſame way by which you ſhall have ſinn'd, and that for the Pleaſures you ſhall have taken during your Youth, which are ſoon paſt, he ſend you the anguiſh and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a misfortunate Marriage, which will continue all your Life.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When you ſhall be at the time of thinking of Marriage, be careful to look upon it with a chaſt and pure Eye, and have nothing but a holy Intention, which ſeeks not Pleaſure and Delight in ſo pious a thing, but the vertuous End which a Chriſtian ought to propoſe to himſelf. The Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> hath declar'd it in a word to young <hi>Toby;</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Accipies vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem cum ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Domini, amore filio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum magis quam libidine ductus. <hi>Tob.</hi> 6.</note> 
                        <hi>You ſhall Marry in the Fear of God, with an intention of having Children, and not thro' a love of Pleaſures.</hi> Call to mind the terrible Example of the ſeven Husbands of young <hi>Sara,</hi> who were all ſtifled by the Devil on the Day of their Nuptials, and learn from thence the Cauſe which the ſame Angel told to <hi>Toby;</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Audi me &amp; oſtendam tibi qui ſunt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus praevale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re poteſt dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium. Hi namque qui conjugium ita ſuſcipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, ut Deum à ſe &amp; à ſua mente excludant, &amp; ſuae libidini ita vacent ſicut equus &amp; mulus quibus non eſt intellectus, habet poteſtatem Daemonium ſuper eos. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Give ear to me,</hi> ſays he to him, <hi>and I ſhall
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:33523:249"/>tell you who thoſe are, over whom the Devil hath power: For thoſe who enter into Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, not having God with them, or thinking on him, and who only ſeek wanton Pleaſures as Beaſts which have no Reaſon, are they over whom the Devil hath power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Imprint theſe words deeply in your Mind, and know, that if the Devil only kill'd thoſe immediately who abus'd the Sanctity of Marriage, he wants not other Means to exerciſe over them the power God hath given him, whereof he diſcovers but too many Effects by all the Miſeries with which he infeſts Marriage. They who would not fall into them, ought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Cauſe, and have nothing but a chaſt Love in their Heart, ſo that they may truly ſay to God thoſe excellent words of young <hi>Toby,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Et nunc, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, tu ſcis quia non lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xuriae cauſa accipio ſoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem meam conjugem, ſed ſola poſteritatis dilectione, in qua benedicatur no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tuum in ſaecula ſaeculorum. <hi>Tob.</hi> 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that it is not the love of Pleaſures which makes me take this Wife, but the deſire of a holy Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which may bleſs thy Name for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When you ſhall have a good Intention, employ the convenient Means to deliberate well on ſo important an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. The Firſt, and moſt neceſſary, is to conſult God by Prayer, ſince a good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is the Gift of God, and one of his
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:33523:250"/>greateſt Favors for thoſe who embrace that State, as we have ſhewn you. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there being nothing more difficult than to know well the Diſpoſition and Humor of the Perſon, the Divine Aſſiſtance is moſt particularly neceſſary, that you may not be deceiv'd therein, and this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance ought to be demanded; to Prayer muſt be added all human and vertuous Means to underſtand well the Diſpoſition of the Perſon, that you may not be engag'd in a bad Subject; and know before you Love.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When you ſhall be at the point of ſeeing the accompliſhment of this great Affair, remember to avoid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Faults which we have pointed at above, and are uſually committed at the Celebration of Marriage. And Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Sacrament, which ought to be receiv'd in the State of Grace, you muſt diſpoſe your ſelf for it by Confeſſion and Communion. 'Tis true, 'tis ordinarily done, but it is alſo true, that it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform'd ſo badly, that there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in ones whole Life that is worſe made; for it is often without Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with a Mind full of Diſtractions, which thinks of nothing leſs than of God, and the Affairs of Salvation, but is intent upon the Exceſs, Vanity, and Pomps of the World: Not to ſpeak of thoſe who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs in haſte, without Examen, without Contrition, without having thought of the amendment of their Life, which makes
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:33523:250"/>them, commit one Sacrilege in Confeſſion, and another in receiving the Sacrament of Matrimony. Not to ſpeak alſo of thoſe, who having Confeſs'd themſelves well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into Sin before Matrimony, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires or immodeſt Actions. There is no need to tell you much theſe Confeſſions may draw Misfortunes upon Marriages: For beſides that it makes them loſe all the Graces which the Sacrament confers on Marry'd Perſons, to acquit themſelves of the Obligations of their State, and that for want of theſe Graces they fall into a vaſt number of Sins, they draw upon them alſo the Malediction of God, who ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf offended by a Sacrilege at the time when they have moſt need of his Grace. Avoid this ſo important and dreadful a Fault, when that time is come. Content not your ſelf with an ordinary Confeſſion. Take time to think ſeriouſly of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by retiring privately for ſome Days, or for ſome Hours in many Days; and in that Retirement Pray to God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Grace, implore his Mercy, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min well your Conſcience to Confeſs all your Sins, propoſe to your ſelf to live pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for the future, and to acquit your ſelf of all the Obligations of your Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and to perform the better all theſe things, make choice of a diſcreet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, of whom you may receive all the Advices neceſſary for you. Read ſome Books which may inſtruct you in the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Matrimony, and in its Obligations.
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:33523:251"/>I adviſe you to read the Hiſtory of <hi>Toby</hi> in the Sacred Scripture, you will there find Rules, and the Model of a truly holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, with the Bleſſings which crown'd it.</p>
                     <p>In fine, In the Celebration of the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptials be mindful to avoid the Exceſs in Clothes and Feaſts, and all Expences which ſhall be only for Vanity, and inſtead of thoſe Expences, which are only done to pleaſe Men, give ſome conſiderable Alms to the Poor, which will attract the Divine Benediction upon you, as it is ſaid to <hi>Toby,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Cumque dixiſſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, acceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivium: ſed &amp; cum timore Domini nuptiarum convivium exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebant. <hi>Tob.</hi> 9.</note> That <hi>after the Nuptial Benediction they made the Wedding Feaſt, but in the ſight and fear of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Be careful that all things be manag'd with Vertue and Modeſty, ſo that God be no wiſe offended. When you Invite your Relations and Friends, remember to Invite <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> thither; that is, beſeech him that he will be preſent by his Grace, and give his Bleſſing to it, as he did to the Wedding of <hi>Cana.</hi> Forget not alſo to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite thither his holy Mother: It was ſhe who had a care to ſupply what was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe Nuptials, and who beſeech'd her Son to have compaſſion on them, and by that Prayer obtain'd that great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the change of Water into Wine: She will perform the ſame in reſpect of you, if you Pray to her as you ought. For,

                     <head type="sub">The Concluſion of the foregoing Chapter.</head>
                     <p>In fine, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> when you ſhall be once engag'd in a worldly Life, and in the State of Matrimony, propoſe to your ſelf to live therein in ſuch a manner, that your State be not a cauſe of your Damnation, but a certain Means of your Salvation. It was on this Conſideration that you made choice of it, and God hath given it you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this End. Labor therefore to follow the Intention of God, and to put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that which you your ſelf have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. For this reaſon I have above pointed at the Obligations of your State, and the Dangers with which it abounds, that you may avoid theſe, and have a care to diſcharge your ſelf of the other.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Obligations may be reduc'd to
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:33523:252"/>four Things, which Marry'd People ow to four Perſons, to God, their Conſort, their Children, and themſelves. They ow to God a holy Life, and well regulated in the Path of his Commandments; To their Wife, an inviolable Fidelity; To their Children, the care of Educating them in the Fear of God; And to themſelves, the care of their Salvation, by preferring it before all Temporal Bleſſings. Propoſe to your ſelf theſe four Obligations, as the indiſpenſible Rules which you ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have before your Eyes, to acquit your ſelf faithfully of them.</p>
                     <p>As for the Dangers, uſe all your Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors abſolutely to avoid them: We have above reduc'd them to four, which are the moſt ordinary Sources of all, both Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Spiritual Miſeries, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Marry'd Perſons.</p>
                     <p>You will prevent the Firſt and Third, by placing frequently before your Eyes that Expreſſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Qui amat patrem aut matrem plus quam me, non eſt me dignus. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.</note> 
                        <hi>He who loves his Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> If you love God as you ought, you will love him above all things, that is, more than any thing that is moſt dear to you in the World. He who loves him not in this manner, ſhall never be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to poſſeſs him in his Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Wiſe and Children muſt be lov'd next to God, according to God, and for God.</p>
                     <p>The Second Danger which ſprings from the Averſion which ſometimes ariſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                  <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of a Single Life.</head>
                  <p>I Speak not here of the Single Life of Prieſts and Religious, but of the State of Continence, which Perſons of both Sexes ſometimes obſerve in the World; which may happen two ways, by Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity or by Election. By Neceſſity, when for ſome Cauſe which depends not on us, as Poverty, Infirmity, or ſome other invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Impediment, a Man cannot attain to a good Marriage. By Election, when by deliberate Purpoſe one renounces the State of Matrimony, to live in a perpetual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence.</p>
                  <p>They who chance to be oblig'd to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence by the former Way, have need of much Vertue, to ſave themſelves in a State wherein they remain againſt their Will.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt thing to be done, is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſiſt the Vexation their Condition obliges them to. They ought to conſider, that it is God who by his Will hath plac'd
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:33523:253"/>them in that State; that he hath done it for good Reaſons, and chiefly for their Salvation: From whence it follows, that he will not fail to beſtow on them, all the Graces neceſſary to obſerve Continence, and live holily in their Condition. Now after all, they have this Advantage, which is found in none of the other States, to be fully aſſur'd that their Vocation comes from God, and by conſequence nothing will be wanting on his part, to effect their Salvation in the State wherein God hath plac'd them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Being convinc'd of theſe Truths, they muſt perform a Second thing, which is, as it is ordinarily ſaid, make a Vertue of Neceſſity, by doing thro' a voluntary acceptance of their State, what they would have done by chooſing it freely, if they had had their Wiſh; That is to ſay, they muſt embrace their Condition as coming from the Hand of God, and conſecrate to him their Chaſtity, as a Preſent he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them, which may be as pleaſing to him as if they had offer'd it by their expreſs and proper Motion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After they have thus voluntarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Condition God hath plac'd them in, they muſt propoſe to live holily therein, and uſe the neceſſary Means for that End, which are the ſame we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to give to them who make choice of it by their own proper Will.</p>
                  <p>I come now to thoſe who voluntarily prefer the State of Continence before that
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:33523:254"/>of Marriage, and I ſay they have need of many Advertiſements, which I beſeech you, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to weigh well if you be of that number.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, to Examin well the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which induces you to embrace this Choice, and the Life you would lead in that Condition: For, if you only make choice of the State of Continence to avoid the Troubles and Perplexity of Marriage, and if you would live in that Condition with all the liberty a Man gives himſelf in Marriage, to take therein all your Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to converſe with Women, and be as much in Divertiſements and worldly Company as if you were Marry'd, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your Choice is worth nothing; it is a Snare the Devil lays for you, to make you fall into an infinite number of Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chaſtity, from which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to preſerve your ſelf amidſt Pleaſures, and ſo many Dangers and Occaſions. If you will chooſe well the State of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and according to God, you muſt embrace it by a Motive of Piety, that is, to pleaſe God more in that State, and to effect your Salvation better. This is the ſole and only Intention you ought to have in chooſing ſo perfect a State as that, and they who have it not cannot, but have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd it on an ill Account, and with danger of concluding miſerably therein. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Theotime,</hi> Examin ſeriouſly that which you have, be careful of being deceiv'd in it; be ſolicitous to confer with ſome wiſe and pious Perſon about it.</p>
                  <pb n="489" facs="tcp:33523:254"/>
                  <p>Secondly, When you ſhall be aſſur'd of your Intention, you muſt come to the Means to acquit your ſelf well of that State, whereof the firſt is to know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the Greatneſs of it, the Advantages, and the Dangers.</p>
                  <p>As for the Greatneſs, I ſhall not inſiſt here to Diſcourſe of what the Fathers have ſaid of the State of Continence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that would be endleſs; it ſuffices to ſay, that this State ſurpaſſes much that of Marriage; And altho' that be good and holy, as well by its Inſtitution, which comes from God, as for other Reaſons we have ſpoken of above, the State of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is yet better, and much more holy.</p>
                  <p>It ſurpaſſes that of Marriage, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Church ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">Utriuſque rei congrua diſcretione momenta pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantes tantum dicimus à ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis nuptiis ſanctam virginitatem merito potiore diſtare, quantum diſtant à bonis meliora, ab humilibus celſa, à terrenis coeleſtia, à beatis beatiora à ſanctis ſanctiora. <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Advantages of this State are great,<note n="*" place="margin">Qui fine uxore eſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus eſt quae Domini ſunt, quomodo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat Deo, &amp; mulier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nupta &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go cogitat quae Domini ſunt, ut ſit ſancta corpore &amp; ſpiritu. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath compris'd them in few words, when he ſaid, That they who were unmarry'd had their Minds more free and diſengag'd from worldly Affairs, have better Means to think upon God, to pleaſe him, and to ſanctific themſelves both in Body and Mind.</p>
                  <pb n="490" facs="tcp:33523:255"/>
                  <p>The Obligations of the ſame State are no leſs than its Advantages. It obligeth to two great Vertues, the practice of which are very difficult, Chaſtity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. Chaſtity doth not only oblige to abſtain from the Pleaſures which Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony may render lawful, but alſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an abſolute, entire, and perfect Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mind and Body, and to fly afar off from whatſoever may in the leaſt wound Modeſty in Thought, Word, or Deed. And Humility obliges them to preſerve themſelves carefully from falling into Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or having any good Opinion or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of themſelves for the illuſtrious Vertue of Virginal Chaſtity. Theſe two Vertues ought to be inſeparable, and they have ſo great a connection one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that S. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> calls them by the ſame Name,<note place="margin">Propter quod non eſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti virginibus negligentius intuendum, quantum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis virginitas carnis virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitati prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderet: haec enim ſi à fidelibus conjugatis ac viduis in fide per dilectionem operatur, etiam ſine virginitate corporea, in hac vita fuerit cuſtodita in futuro, nec carnis virginita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te privabitur, &amp; regni coeleſtis beatitudine perfruetur. Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis vero virginitas, etiam Deo dicata, ſi virginitatem non ſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit cordis, nihil proderit in corpore cuſtodita, ſi ſpiritalis caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas fuerit in mente corrupta. <hi>S. Fulgen. de Virginitate.</hi>
                     </note> ſaying, That Humility is the Virginity of the Mind; and that it is ſo neceſſary for that of the Body, that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Chaſtity advantages nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that of the Mind, it being certain, that Marry'd Perſons ſhall be Sav'd without obſerving Corporal Virginity, and that Virgins ſhall not without the Spiritual, which is Humility.</p>
                  <pb n="491" facs="tcp:33523:255"/>
                  <p>From theſe two great Obligations it is eaſie to judge of the Dangers of that State; they are as great as theſe two Vertues are difficult to practiſe, and to joyn together; and the Enemy of our Salvation em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys all his Endeavors againſt Virgins, to make them loſe both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is alſo the Judgment of that great Saint, who ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">Utramque Diabolus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequitur, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramque cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidis conſiliis inſectatur, ſed virginitatem carnis per ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem niti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur praeripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, cordis vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitatem per ſeipſum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur auferre: nam plerum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad hoc carnis virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatem quae exterior eſt, non impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat ut illius quae potior eſt fundamenta ſuffodiat, &amp;c. Et cum certamini manifeſto cedit, ad hoc ſe victum demonſtrat, ut vincat, &amp;c. Evidentibus quippe vitiis provocat dum virginitatem carnis im pugnat: in quibus ſi palam ſuperetur, illico ſuperbiam pernicioſiſſime jaculatur, &amp; vitiorum author in eo quod vincere non poteſt vitiis ſuis, vincit virtutibus alienis. <hi>S. Fulgent. ibid.</hi>
                     </note> That the Devil aſſaults ſtrongly theſe two Vertues in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of both Sexes, and when he cannot carry away the firſt by Temptations, he endeavors to raviſh the ſecond by Illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He alſo adds, That ſometimes he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks not ſo ſtrongly the Chaſtity of the Body, that he may more eaſily prevail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that of the Mind, which is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; That he lets himſelf be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in the Temptations of the Fleſh, that by this Victory he may inſtill Pride into the Mind of him who hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and that not being able to conquer Virgins by open-fac'd Vice, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires into them, he gains them by ſins which he draws from their own Vertue.</p>
                  <p>It behoveth you therefore, <hi>Theotime,</hi> to be admoniſh'd of theſe Dangers, that they may not divert you from embracing the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:33523:256"/>State of Continence, if you be inclin'd thereunto by a good Motive, ſuch as we have ſpoken of; for if it be true, that the Perſecution againſt Virgins is great, it is yet more true, that the Grace of God is ſtronger to defend and preſerve them; and that God by his Goodneſs fails not to aſſiſt with his powerful Favors, thoſe who embrace ſo difficult a State, to Serve him more perfectly, and who ſeek all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Means to diſcharge themſelves well, whereof the firſt is that which we have ſpoken of, that is, to know well the Greatneſs, the Obligations and the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of that State.</p>
                  <p>The other Means which he muſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe after this, are Prayer, and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon holy things, Labor, and all thoſe others we have ſhewn above in Part 3.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:33523:256"/>with a great number of good Admonitions againſt the Occaſions they ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd unto, of departing from God, and being utterly deſtroy'd in that Pagan Country.<note n="*" place="margin">Et dedit il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis legem ne obliviſceren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur praecepta Domini, &amp; ut non exerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus videntes ſimulacra ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentea &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea &amp; ornamenta eorum, &amp; alia hujuſmodi, dicens, hortabatur ne legem amoverent à corde ſuo. 2 <hi>Machab.</hi> 2.</note>

And in telling them many ſuch like things, he exhorted them that they ſhould never let the Law of God be remov'd from their Hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What that holy Prophet did in that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion concerning the Jews, I ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form here is reſpect of you, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> and with as much neceſſity.

For this reaſon I exhort you with the Prophet to have a care of your ſelf, that the Law of God may never be taken
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:33523:257"/>out of your Heart. For this end I have prepar'd for you the following Advices which I beſeech you to read with much attention, as moſt important for your Salvation.</p>

                     <head>ADVICE I.</head>
                     <head type="sub">That the time of iſſuing out of Youth, and entring into the World, is the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all the Life, and many are ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreckt therein.</head>
                     <p>This is the firſt Advertiſement I give you, and which I wiſh may be deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in the Minds of all young People, to make them very much ſtand in fear of ſo ſlippery a Step, and ſo dangerous a Place for their Age, where many run mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately into Ruin.</p>
                     <p>It is there where the Devil waits for them, and where he hopes his Attempts will not be vain and unprofitable: He finds then all the poſſible Advantages to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from Vertue, if before they have been bred up therein, or engage them more deeply in Vice; The Liberty they begin to enjoy, the Idleneſs whereinto they eaſily fall at that time, the greater Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they have of committing III, the eaſier Means they have to give themſelves to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment and take their Pleaſures, the new Companies which they frequent, where they ſoon learn the Spirit of the World, Vanity, Pride, love of Pleaſures, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims of the World, the Imitation of the Wicked, and the entire corruption of
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:33523:257"/>Manners; the Sentiments of Vertue which they had learnt in their Youth, are eaſily diſlipated; thoſe ſeem now fit only for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they think they muſt have a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd and elevated Spirit, they contemn what they eſteem'd before, the moſt pious Reſolutions appear to them the Effects of Simplicity; and from thence ſprings the ruin of Vertue, and the entire corruption of their Manners, which follows that of the Mind.</p>
                     <p>This Truth is very manifeſt, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence makes it daily appear, to the great regret of thoſe whom the Salvation of Youth moves never ſo little.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> had made trial of this to his great Damage, as he himſelf deplores it in his Confeſſions, where he ſays, That Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Affairs, having made him leave off his Studies<note n="*" place="margin">Sed ubi ſex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to illo decimo anno interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito otio, ex neceſſitate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtica feria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ab omni ſchola, cum parentibus eſſe coepi, exceſſerunt caput meum vepres libidinum, &amp; nulla erat eradicans manus. <hi>S.

                     <p>As for the Sentiments, know that Vertue is always one and the ſame, and in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Age or Occaſion you be in, you are ſtill oblig'd to conſecrate your ſelf to God, to obey and ſerve him faithfully.</p>
                     <p>As for the Practices remember, that if you be oblig'd to Vertue, you are alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd in like manner to all the neceſſary Means to acquire and conſerve it; ſuch are the Practices we have ſpoken of above. Wherefore I adviſe you, as a thing moſt important for your Salvation, not to deſiſt
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:33523:259"/>from them; if you leave them off, you ruin your ſelf in Vice. Be diligent in Praying, in Reading good Books, in frequenting the Sacraments, in Converſing with vertuous Perſons, and chiefly in diſcovering your Conſcience to a diſcreet Ghoſtly Father, whether to him who directed you before, if you can have him, for that is always beſt, or to another. It is in this that all young People are defective at that time. From the time they begin to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they will not diſcover themſelves to any Perſon; they fly from thoſe who may keep them in the good Path, or ſet them right when they are gone aſtray, which is the cauſe why they remove themſelves ſo ſo far from them, and often never, or too late return to them.</p>
                     <p>Act not in this manner, <hi>Theotime,</hi> call to mind that St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> attributes to this Cauſe the Diſorder he fell into at the end of his Studies, becauſe he had no one to take care to root out the Vices which then grew in his Soul. Forget not alſo what the Scripture recounts of King <hi>Joas,</hi> That <hi>he was vertuous as long as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the High Prieſt Joiada,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fecit Joas rectum coram Domino cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis diebus quibus docuit cum Joiada ſacerdos. 4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 3.</note> he had no ſooner loſt the Conduct of that holy Man, but he became wicked and was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ruin'd.</p>

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that this Irreſolution hinders them from applying themſelves to any ſetled Labor; it makes them loſe much time, which might be uſefully employ'd; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them to many Temptations, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Sadneſs and Diſcontent; and when it continues long, it renders them unfit for any thing that's good all the reſt of their Life, as we daily ſee.</p>

                     <p>The Evils which this Inconſtancy cauſes
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:33523:262"/>in a young Man, cannot be ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd: The Devil makes uſe of it to caſt him into Melancholy, Vexation, and Diſquiet; from thence into a long Idleneſs, to make him loſe unprofitably the beſt part of his Life, and hinder him from making himſelf capable of any good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. He there takes occaſion of moving him to Impatience, to a Diſtaſt of Vertue, to a Looſneſs in the Exerciſe of Piety, and of caſting him into great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and often deeply into Vice.</p>
                     <p>This made the Wiſeman ſay,<note place="margin">Sicut avis tranſmigrans de nido ſuo, ſic vir qui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relinquit lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum ſuum. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.</note> That <hi>he who changes his Reſolution, is like a Bird which leaves her Neſt:</hi> For as that Bird finds neither Repoſe nor Security, flying up and down without meeting with any Reſting-place, expoſing her Life to many Dangers; ſo an unconſtant Man finds no Quiet, but expoſes his Soul to many Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards.</p>

                     <p>The Second is of thoſe who give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Works of Counſel,<note place="margin">Second.</note> and leave thoſe of Command and Obligation. Such is the Piety of the Maſter of a Family, who applies himſelf to frequent the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be diligent at Church, to viſit Hoſpitals, and in the mean time neglects the care he ought to have of his Family, to Inſtruct his Children, to withdraw them from Vice when they are engag'd therein, to be ſolicitous for the Salvation of his Domeſticks, to watch over their Actions, to avoid the Diſorders of his Houſe, to pay his Debts, to reſtore ill-gotten Goods.</p>
                     <p>The Third is of thoſe,<note place="margin">Third.</note> who amongſt the things commanded obſerve ſome and leave others, practiſe thoſe which they find to be moſt facil, or conformable to their Inclination, and omit thoſe which ſeem to them more difficult. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there are who would do no wrong to their Neighbor in his Goods, and yet make no ſcruple of taking away their Honor by Detraction. Others have an averſion for Drunkenneſs, but not for Impurity. Others hate lewd Actions, but not unchaſt Deſires and Diſcourſes.

Now all theſe Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are falſe, becauſe he who is defective in one ſole Commandment hath no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth is of thoſe who obſerve the things of Obligation which are common to all Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> and perform not thoſe which

Thus for a Superior, a Paſtor, a Magiſtrate, to live like an honeſt Man, and in the mean time to neglect the care of his Charge, and the particular Obligations of his Calling, is not a true, but falſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

                     <p>Nor a ſingular Vertue, which ſequeſters it ſelf from the Ways of others, to follow extraordinary Practices, new Devotions, affected Singularities, which are often the Effects of a ſecret and great Preſumption.</p>
                     <p>Nor a mean, ſilly, and childiſh Vertue, which trembles where it ought not to fear, ſtands in dread where it ought not to doubt, which makes a ſcruple of things which are not Sins, and no difficulty of thoſe which are.</p>
                     <pb n="510" facs="tcp:33523:265"/>
                     <p>Nor on the contrary, a raſh, and too bold a Vertue, which under pretext of not committing great Crimes, gives it ſelf liberty for all other Sins, which is a great Error, becauſe he who contemns little Faults, ſhall fall into great ones.</p>
                     <p>Nor an imprudent and indiſcreet Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which takes no care of many Fults which offend their Neighbor, and which deſtroys more by its ill Conduct, than it edifies by the Good it does.</p>
                     <p>Nor a human and politick Vertue, which acts Good for worldly Conſiderations, to pleaſe ſome one, to be eſteem'd, to obtain ſome Deſign; briefly, which regards its ſelf in all things it performs.</p>

                  <p>To avoid this Misfortune, ſee here the Means you muſt practiſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Be faithful to the Divine Favors; for as the holy Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſays admirably,<note n="*" place="margin">Deus enim niſi illius gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae defueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſicut cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit opus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ita perficiet, operans velle &amp; perficere. <hi>Conc.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Live always in Humility, in Fear, in a Diſtruſt of your ſelf, in the Exerciſe of good Works: for according to the Doctrin of the ſame Council,<note n="*" place="margin">In Dei au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xilio ſirmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ſpem collocare &amp; reponere om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes debent, &amp;c.

Formidare enim debent, ſcientes quod in ſpem gloriae, at nondum in gloriam renati ſunt, de pugna quae ſupereſt cum carne, cum mundo, cum diabolo, in qua victores eſſe non poſſunt, niſi cum gratia Dei Apoſtolo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperent dicenti, debitores ſumus non carni, ut ſecundum carnem vivamus, ſi autem Spiritu facta carnis mortificaveritis, vivetes. <hi>Sup.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Altho' every one ſhould firmly truſt to the Divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, yet nevertheleſs thoſe who think they ſtand, ought to have a care they fall not, and work their Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:33523:274"/>by Labor, by Watching, by Alms, by Prayers, by Offerings, by Faſts, by Charity. Becauſe not being as yet regenerated to Glory, but only to the Hopes of enjoying it, they ought to ſtand in fear of the Battel with the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, in which they muſt yet engage, and in which they cannot conquer, unleſs by the Grace of God they obey the Apoſtle, who admoniſhes us not to live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh; for if we live according to it, we ſhall die, but if by the Spirit we ſhall mortifie in us the works of the Fleſh, we ſhall live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third Means is diligently to have a care of Five things. 1. To fly the dangerous Occaſions of offending God; for he who preſerves not himſelf from Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhall fall therein. 2. Not to lapſe into a Remiſsneſs, but to riſe as ſoon as we are fall'n, becauſe that eaſily leads to Sin. 3. To avoid the Sins of Omiſſion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, thoſe which are againſt the Obligations of ones State; pious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons often trip groſly in this Point. 4. To preſerve your ſelf from a ſecret Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, which inſenſibly mingling it ſelf with Vertue, is a great Diſpoſition to a Fall and Precipice. 5. To avoid a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:33523:275"/>of Venial ſins, which being neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lead to Mortal.<note n="*" place="margin">Qui ſpernit modica paula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim decidet. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 19.</note> 
                     <hi>He who deſpiſes ſmall Faults,</hi> ſays the Wiſeman, <hi>will fall by little and little.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Fourth Means is, to Examin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Condition of your Soul, her Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, her Inclinations, her Affections; to know thoſe which are ill, and correct them. For this reaſon you muſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect upon your ſelf, and from time to time, or at leaſt once a Year, review and renew your interior State, that you may get freſh Forces in the Service of God. To read often the Advices given above in Ch. 14. and Chriſtian Maxims in Ch. 15. will alſo help very much.</p>
                  <p>And in fine, the great, neceſſary, and moſt effectual Means, is to Pray much, and beg of God frequently this holy Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Hence it is that the Son of God ſays, that<note n="a" place="margin">Vigilate &amp; orate. <hi>Marc.</hi> 13.

                     <hi>we muſt Watch and Pray, that we muſt Pray always without intermiſſion.</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays, that it is only granted to thoſe that Pray for it. And the Second Council of <hi>Orange</hi> teaches us, that even<note n="b" place="margin">Adjutorium Dei etiam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natis &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis ſemper eſt imploran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ut ad finem bonum pervenire, vel in bono poſſint opere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d rare. <hi>Concil.

                     <hi>the Faithful and Saints ought always to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Divine Aſſiſtance, that they may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a good End, or perſevere in good Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O <hi>Theotime,</hi> how happy would you be, if having begun to ſerve God in your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Years, you have a care to ſay with

            <p>I Preſent you here, dear <hi>Theotime,</hi> with this ſmall Inſtruction, as an important Piece, which I thought was wanting in that I gave you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

            <pb n="533" facs="tcp:33523:276"/>
            <p>Upon this Thought I conceiv'd it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to defer it, and in the mean time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what uſe you made of the Book, and what Bleſſing God would be pleas'd to lay upon it. Seeing then the Succeſs which by the Divine Goodneſs it hath had, and that its apparent Benefit oblig'd me to repeat the Edition, I could ſtay no longer from preſenting you with a Practice of ſuch importance, without which not only all this Book, but alſo all the Inſtructions you ſhall receive in your whole Life, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unprofitable.</p>
            <p>Entertain then this Doctrin with Love; and altho' it be plac'd at the end of the Book, yet for that reaſon read it not laſt, becauſe it may help you to reap a Profit by reading all that is taught in this Book.</p>

               <head>ARTICLE I.</head>
               <head type="sub">What is it to Meditate?</head>
               <p>It is not that which the generality of Men imagin, who conceive that Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a high Speculation of ſublime things, that has no other end than to acquire ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Thoughts and Knowledges which others have not, wherein they are notably deceiv'd.</p>
               <p>Meditation doth not conſiſt in high Thoughts, but in thoſe which are good and wholſom; nor only in pious Thoughts, but in holy Affections which ſpring from thence; as to hate Sin, to love God, to
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:33523:277"/>fear his Judgments, and in the Reſolutions which are made in conſequence of theſe Thoughts and Affections.</p>
               <p>So that to Meditate, is to apply ones Mind attentively to conſider the Truths of Salvation, to ſtir up ones ſelf to love them, and reſolve to practiſe them.</p>
               <p>Now that you may have a juſt Idea of Meditation, it may be defin'd in theſe Terms. Meditation is a ſerious and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Reflection, which is made in the Preſence of God, and by the aſſiſtance of his Grace, upon the Truths of Salvation, to know them perfectly, to love them, and to put them in practice.</p>
               <p>Obſerve well this Definition, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each Word, becauſe there is not one which hath not its Senſe and Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you will yet underſtand better by the following Articles, and particularly by the Ninth.</p>

               <head type="sub">That without Meditating it is hard to effect our Salvation.</head>
               <p>This Truth follows from the former Definition. For if Meditation be nothing elſe but a frequent and ſerious Reflection upon the Truths of Salvation, to know them, to love them, and to practiſe them, it is certain that it is a thing alſo difficult to effect ones Salvation without Meditating, as it is hard to practiſe the
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:33523:277"/>Truths of the ſame Salvation without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, and to love them without knowing them, and to know them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking ſeriouſly and frequently on them, which is that which we call Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, and without often demanding of God the Grace to know them, to love them, and to practiſe them, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd principally by Prayer. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for this reaſon attributes the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent loſs of the Salvation of Men, and corruption of Manners, to the want of Reflection. <hi>Deſolatione deſolata eſt terra quia non eſt qui recogitet corde; The Earth is all repleniſh'd with Deſolation, becauſe there is no Perſon who revolves in his Heart the Truths of Salvation.</hi> Weigh well this Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is moſt certain, and which will be yet more ſetled in you by what follows.</p>

               <head type="sub">That Meditation is not ſo difficult as many conceive it.</head>
               <p>This is a Truth which is eaſie to be made appear. Is it not a ſtrange thing, that Men ſhould account that hard, yea even impoſſible, which is perform'd daily in all manner of Subjects, except that of Salvation? What Merchant is there who doth not often, and ſeriouſly think on the Affairs of his Traffick? He who hath a Proceſs or Suit at Law, doth he not daily caſt in his Mind the Means to gain it? and that not lightly, and haſtily, but ſeriouſly, with attention, with Affection, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Execution all the Means he finds. To act in this manner, is that which we underſtand by Meditating.</p>
               <p>Do not you your ſelf, <hi>Theotime,</hi> who are as yet perhaps in your Studies, meditate when you are at your Book, compoſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, or learning a Queſtion in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, or any other Science? You apply your Mind to comprehend it, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and reap profit from what you learn: All this is nothing elſe but Meditating. Why then cannot you do that for your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation, which you perform for a Temporal Science?</p>
               <p>I ſay more, Why can you not perform that for your Salvation, which you do for your Divertiſement, on which you think
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:33523:279"/>ſo often, with ſo much application and pleaſure, that frequently you have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thoughts but thoſe, and they totally take up your Mind? Why do you medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſo eaſily upon your Pleaſures, and cannot meditate on your Salvation? Why in fine, can you do leſs for Vertue, than the Impious for Vice and Wickedneſs? When they have an ill Deſign to put in Execution, they perpetually think on it, they take no greater Pleaſure, than in ſeeking and finding the Means to effect it.</p>

               <p>I have ſaid moreover that young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have need of Meditating for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which ſeems to me convincing; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lightneſs of Mind natural to their Age, hinders them ordinarily from applying themſelves ſo much as they ought to the thoughts of their Salvation: They eaſily receive Knowledges, but they are as ſoon blotted out of their Mind, becauſe they make not Reflections on them. This is what hinders them from profiting in Vertue; they have therefore great need of ſome Means which may keep their Mind attentive, and accuſtom them to weigh things with Reflection: Now a little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in Meditation ſerves marvellouſly for this.</p>
               <p>The ſame Lightneſs of Mind puts an Impediment to their advancing in the moſt neceſſary Means of their Salvation, and particularly in three, that is, in Prayer, in the Word of God, and in reading pious Books.</p>
               <p>They Pray without Attention and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; They recite their Prayers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:33523:280"/>thinking on what they ſay; They ſpeak to God with their Lips, but not with their Heart; Their Tongue talks, but their Heart is ſilent, and yet it is the Heart alone which Prays and obtains; it is that alone to whoſe Voice and Language Almighty God gives ear. Now this Prayer of the Heart is learnt in the Exerciſe of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of the Word of God, they often hearken to it with a moſt wandring and diſtracted Mind; where, if they give any Attention to it, they make no Reflection on the Verities they have learnt, which is the cauſe why they ſo ſoon ſlip out of their Memory, and they loſe all the Fruit of them.</p>
               <p>The like befalls them in reading of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Books, to which they apply not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but with trouble, and get no profit by them. This ſprings from their Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, which cannot apply it ſelf to ſerious and profitable Thoughts, unleſs it be in good time accuſtom'd and fram'd to it. Now this is perform'd by the Exerciſe of Meditation, which accuſtoms them to raiſe their Mind to God, to fix their Thoughts upon an Object of Piety, to form holy Affections therein, and take conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Reſolutions.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the great Benefit of Meditation.</head>
               <p>The great and general Benefit we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from this holy Exerciſe is, That we learn there to know ſolidly the Truths of Salvation, to love them, and put them in practice. Theſe are the three Effects of Meditation, which cannot be ſufficiently eſteem'd, becauſe they comprehend all that is neceſſary for Salvation.</p>
               <p>Beſides thoſe, there are two others, which deſerve a particular Conſideration, becauſe they are the Fountain of the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Meditation teaches us to ſpeak to God, and to hear God when he do's us the Favor to ſpeak to us.<note n="*" place="margin">Chriſtum alloquimur cum oramus, Chriſtum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus cum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina legimus oracula. <hi>S. Ambr.</hi> 1. <hi>Offic.</hi> 20.</note> We ſpeak to God when we Pray, and when we beg of him thoſe things we ſtand in need of; God ſpeaks to us when he interiorly inſpires us, illuminating our Underſtandings by good Thoughts, exciting our Will by good Motions which he gives it, and animating us to put them in Execution.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe two Actions, Speaking to God with our Heart, and Hearkning to
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:33523:282"/>him when he ſpeaks to our Heart, depends abſolutely our Salvation, that is, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, progreſs, and perfecting of our Sanctification. It is for this reaſon that the Fathers have recommended them to us with ſo much care. <hi>One while ſpeak to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nunc cum Deo loquere, nunc Deus tecum.</note> (ſays S. <hi>Jerom</hi>) <hi>another while give ear to what God ſpeaks to you.</hi> In ſpeaking to God, we beſeech him that he will come to us by his Grace; In hearkning unto him, we open our Heart for him to enter there. In ſpeaking to him, we demand of him his Lights and Favors; In hearkning to him, we receive them, and encloſe them in our Heart to conſerve and practiſe them.</p>
               <p>What Honor, <hi>Theotime,</hi> and Happineſs is this, to be able to ſpeake to God freely and familiarly, and that he ſhould vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſpeak to us, and inſpire us with his holy Will! A Happineſs which Men know ſo little how to value, that the greateſt part are even ignorant of the uſe, altho' on it their Eternal Salvation depends. God is always ready to hearken to us, and we ſpeak not to him: He ſpeaks to us, and we know not what it is to hearken to him. What Blindeſs is greater than this, to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thus, ſo honorable, ſo advantagious, and ſo neceſſary a Favor! If Kings of the Earth ſhould give ſo free an Acceſs to their Perſons, and to their familiar Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would be overwhelm'd with the multitude of thoſe who approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. God communicates himſelf with ſuch an incredible Bounty, and he is left
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:33523:283"/>all alone, there are few found who will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage themſelves by it.</p>
               <p>They are chiefly young Perſons who profit the leaſt by theſe Celeſtial Favors; They underſtand not what it is either to ſpeak to God from the bottom of their Heart, or to hearken when he ſpeaks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly to them, as he frequently do's by his holy Inſpirations; which is the cauſe why they neglect them, and loſe the Fruit of them.</p>
               <p>Young <hi>Samuel</hi> being aſleep, heard a Voice which call'd him; he believ'd it was that of his good Maſter the High Prieſt <hi>Hely:</hi> He preſently riſes and goes to him, asking him what his Pleaſure was. The good Man ſends him back, ſaying that he had not call'd him. The young Man having gon three times in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the ſame Voice ſtill awaking him, the good old Man <hi>Hely</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Son, I have not call'd you, but without doubt it is God who ſpeaks to you; wherefore return to your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and if you hear the ſame Voice again, anſwer preſently in this manner, Speak, Lord, for thy Servant hears thee. Samuel</hi> returns, and the ſame Voice having awaked him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he anſwer'd as he was appointed, <hi>Speak, Lord, for thy Servant hears thee,</hi> and God gave him to underſtand all that he had to ſpeak to him.</p>
               <p>Do you ſee, <hi>Theotime,</hi> that God ſpeaks to this young Man, but he hears not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as the Scripture takes notice, he was not then accuſtom'd to that Language;
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:33523:283"/>
                  <hi>Porro Samuel nondum ſciebat Dominum.</hi> But when he had been well Inſtructed, he knew the Voice of God, and he learnt to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to it, and to advantage himſelf infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that Divine School.</p>
               <p>Thus it frequently happens to you, that God ſpeaks to you interiorly by ſo many good Motions which he inſpires you with, and you let them ſlip, becauſe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd not that they came from God, and that it was he that ſpoke to you; this is the reaſon why you loſe ſo many of them, and advantage not your ſelf by them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as yet you have not learnt to hearken to the Voice of God, and anſwer ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to him. Now it is this which we learn by the uſe of Prayer and Meditation.</p>

               <head>ARTICLE IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Method of Meditation.</head>
               <p>All that we have ſaid hitherto, ſerves only to convince you of the Uſe of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is now time to ſhew you the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and diſcover to you how you muſt perform this holy Exerciſe. It is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry therefore to ſpeak to you firſt of the Method to be obſerv'd therein.</p>
               <p>To make you more eaſily comprehend this Method, I ſhall take notice here of ſome important Truths on which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and which it is neceſſary you ſhould comprehend well.</p>
               <p>The Firſt regards the End of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now to Meditate uſefully, you muſt
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:33523:284"/>in the firſt place know the End for which you ought to Meditate, and that this End is nothing elſe but the Sanctification and Salvation of your Soul by the flight of Vice, and the practice of real Vertue. This is that which makes the difference between Meditation and Study of holy things; for we Study to become Knowing, and we Meditate to make our ſelves Good and Vertuous.</p>
               <p>The Second Verity is, That to effect our Salvation, and acquire Vertue, three things are neceſſary, To Know it, to Love, and to Practiſe it.</p>
               <p>The ſole Knowledge doth not ſuffice, except we be inclin'd with an Affection to the Good we know; and the Love of the Good ſerves for nothing, unleſs we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Execution. And this alſo is a difference between Meditation and Study; for Study contents it ſelf with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of holy things, but Meditation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the Love and Practice of Vertue, as its principal End.</p>
               <p>The Third Verity is, That we cannot of our ſelves have any of theſe three things we have ſpoken of, that is, neither good Thoughts for Salvation, nor pious Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, nor any good Reſolutions, except we be inſpir'd with the Grace of God. It is a Truth which our Lord hath taught us, when he ſaid<note n="a" place="margin">Sine me ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil poteſtis ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. <hi>Jo.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>we could do nothing without him;</hi> and his Apoſtle after him, when he affirm'd,<note n="b" place="margin">Non quod ſufficientes ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus cogitare aliquid bonum à nobis quaſi ex nobis, ſed ſufficientia noſtra ex Deo eſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>That we are not able of our ſelves to have any good Thought, but all we do comes
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:33523:284"/>from God.</hi> And in another place,<note n="a" place="margin">Deus eſt qui operatur in nobis &amp; velle &amp; perficere pro bona vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>It is God who gives the Grace and Will to do good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fourth is, That altho' we cannot of our ſelves produce any good Affection or Reſolution for Salvation without the Grace of God, yet God requires, and will have our Cooperation, to give us them, to augment them, to fortifie them, and to make us put them in Execution. For this reaſon he admoniſheth us<note n="b" place="margin">Petite &amp; da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur vobis, quaerite &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venietis, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate &amp; aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etur vobis. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>to ask, to ſeek, to knock at the door.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Cooperation on our part conſiſts in two Actions. 1. In demanding of God humbly, and with perſeverance, the Favor of good Thoughts, pious Affections, and holy Reſolutions for our Salvation. 2. To apply our Minds to conſider attentively the Truths of Salvation, to draw from thence by the Grace of God, convenient Thoughts, Affections, and Reſolutions. This is what God would ſignifie unto us, when he admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd us to ask, to meditate, to conſerve in our Heart the Truths of Salvation.</p>
               <p>Theſe four Maxims being thus ſetled, it is eaſie to make you underſtand the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Meditation, the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of depends upon the underſtanding of three things. 1. To know well the End for which we muſt Meditate. 2. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Acts which muſt be practis'd for that End. 3. The Means which ought to be employ'd to perform well, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably theſe Actions.</p>
               <p>The End of Meditation is the Salvation, or Sanctification of our Soul, by the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:33523:285"/>Sin, by advancing in the Love of God, and by the practice of Chriſtian Vertues. This is the ſole thing which ought to be propos'd and ſought for in this holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p>The Acts to arrive at this End are three, which we have ſpoken of, good Thoughts, pious Affections for Good, and firm and ſolid Reſolutions to practiſe it.</p>
               <p>The Means to perform well theſe Acts, are Prayer, to demand them of God, and the Application of Mind, to conſider the Verities which may move us to the Love of God, and to the Practice of Vertue.</p>
               <p>From the knowledge of theſe three things you may eaſily gather the Order and Method which is to be obſerv'd in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, which comprehends three Parts.</p>
               <p>The Firſt ſerves for Preparation, and conſiſts, 1. In repreſenting to you the End for which you will Meditate, which is to advance you in Vertue. 2. In placing your ſelf in the Preſence of God, and begging of him the Favor, to draw from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject you are going to Meditate on, ſome pious Thoughts, Affections, and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Salvation. But this Prayer muſt be made from the bottom of your Heart, deſiring ardently to obtain that which you demand.</p>
               <p>The Second is Meditation it ſelf, which conſiſts in three Acts, of which we have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpoken; To raiſe good Thoughts, Affections, and Reſolutions, from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on which you Meditate. The Subject
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:33523:285"/>therefore to be Meditated on, muſt be read, and lookt over beforehand; and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made your Prayer to God, the Mind muſt be apply'd to conſider attentively the Thoughts you ſhall have had, and the Motives you ſhall have read upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or others with which God ſhall inſpire you, to draw from thence convenient Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Reſolutions to practiſe them. You muſt perform theſe three Acts in the Preſence of God; conſider, that from him all good Thoughts come, demand them therefore of him very often, and beſeech him to ſpeak to your Heart.<note n="a" place="margin">Loquere, Domine, quia audit ſervus tuus. 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Speak, Lord, for thy Servant hears thee.</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Audiam quid loquatur in me Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.</note> 
                  <hi>I will hearken to what our Lord ſhall ſpeak within me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Exerciſe is practis'd that holy Commerce of which we ſpoke above, of ſpeaking to God, and hearing God when he ſpeaks to us. We ſpeak to him in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and Ruminating in his Preſence on the Subject on which we Meditate. We hearken to him by expecting, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his holy Inſpirations, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in our Heart, and conſerving them to put them in Practice. But this Conference of ſpeaking to God, and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God in our Heart, muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in Repoſe and Silence, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſays, that is, with a quiet and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mind, and deſirous to profit in Vertue.</p>
               <p>The Third Part is the Concluſion, which is effected only by Prayer, wherein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging two things in the ſight of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That all good Thoughts come
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:33523:286"/>from him, and that we know not how to put them in practice but by his Grace; we give him moſt humble thanks for thoſe he hath beſtow'd upon us, and beſeech him that he will give us the Grace to put them in practice.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Theotime,</hi> if you conſider well the Oeconomy or Diſpoſition of Meditation, you will find that it is totally referr'd to two things, to <hi>Pray</hi> and to <hi>Meditate;</hi> this is all which is perform'd in that holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; It is therefore ſometimes call'd <hi>Meditation,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Mental Prayer.</hi> And it is upon theſe two Actions that our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Sanctification depend; We muſt Meditate to fill our Mind with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of pious things, but we muſt Pray to be illuminated by God in this Knowledge, and that the Light we receive therein, may inflame us with the Love of God. We ought therefore to ſay often with good King <hi>Ezechias,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Sicut pullus hirundinis clamabo, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditabor ut co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumba. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.</note> 
                  <hi>I will cry out like a young Swallow, and will meditate like a Dove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, <hi>Theotime,</hi> we interiorly perform in this Exerciſe, the ſame which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elias</hi> did in a viſible Sacrifice which he would offer to God; He prepar'd the Victim, and Wood to burn it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ſet himſelf to Prayer, to demand of God, that he would be pleas'd to ſend him Fire from Heaven, to burn that Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſt; Fire in reality deſcended, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd all the Sacrifice. Thus in this holy Exerciſe of Prayer we prepare our Heart to ſacrifice it to God, we fill it with the
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:33523:286"/>Knowledge of pious things, which are apt to inflame it with the Love of God; but the Celeſtial Fire muſt deſcend upon it; that is, God muſt inflame it with his Grace, and enkindle in it the Fire of his Love, that ſame Fire which he himſelf came to bring into the World, and which he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſires ſhould inflame all our Hearts.</p>

               <p>After we have ſpoken of the Method of Meditation, we muſt now ſpeak of the Subject, or Matter on which you may Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate. Theſe Subjects are generally all the Truths of Salvation, which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd and manifeſted to Men, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof ſerves to excite us to the Love of God; ſuch are theſe which follow.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Greatneſs and Perfections of God, as his Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice, Immenſity, and Eternity.</item>
                  <item>2. The Favors of God towards Men, as Creation, Conſervation, Redemption, Vocation to Chriſtianity, the Grace of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, the particular Benefits we find we have receiv'd from him.</item>
                  <item>3. The Nativity, the Life, the Actions, the Miracles, the Paſſion, the Death, the Reſurrection, the Aſcenſion of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with all his Divine Words, are excellent and plentiful Subjects of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</item>
                  <item>4 The four laſt things of Man, that is, his Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell.</item>
                  <pb n="554" facs="tcp:33523:287"/>
                  <item>5. Sin in general.</item>
                  <item>6. The Sins or Vices in particular, as Pride, Impurity, Intemperance, Anger, Covetouſneſs, Envy, and all others.</item>
                  <item>7. The Chriſtian Vertues oppoſite to theſe Vices, the Love of God, the Love of our Neighbor, Humility, Chaſtity, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, and others.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In fine, We may Meditate upon Faith, and by conſequence upon the Articles of the Creed, upon Hope, and upon every Petition of the <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> or Lord's Prayer, upon Charity, and at the ſame time upon the Commandments of God, all which have relation to Charity.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt Subjects, which are the Perfections of God, we Meditate upon their greatneſs, which may be learnt by Books which treat of them; and we draw from thence convenient Affections, as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, Reſpect, Submiſſion, Fear, Hope, Love.</p>
               <p>Upon the Benefits of God, we conſider their greatneſs by the excellence of the thing which is given, by the Greatneſs of him who gives them, and who beſtows Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors on us out of his pure Goodneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any need of us, by the meanneſs of him who receives the Benefits, that is, of our ſelves; from thence we examin the good or ill Uſe we have made of them, the ingratitude with which we have receiv'd them, the good Uſe we are bound to make of them for the future.</p>
               <p>Upon the Life and Actions of our Lord,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:33523:287"/>we conſider the Circumſtances which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them admirable, the Vertues he made appear therein; from thence we draw powerful Motives of Love, of Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and of Imitation.</p>
               <p>Upon the four laſt things, by looking on them attentively and as at hand, we learn to know them, to fear them, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves for them in good time by a holy Life. This is a very profitable and efficacious Meditation, when it is often perform'd, and with neceſſary application.<note n="*" place="margin">Memorare noviſſima tua &amp; in aeternum non peccabis. <hi>Eccl,</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Remember,</hi> ſays the Wiſeman, <hi>the laſt things, and you ſhall never ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon Sin in general, there are two great Conſiderations, which comprehend all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be reflected on. The Firſt is the Injury Sin offers to God; The Second is the Prejudice and Damage it brings to the Soul of him who commits it.</p>
               <p>The greatneſs and enormity of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury Sin offers to God, may be gather'd from the infinite Majeſty of him who is offended, and the baſeneſs and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him who offends, who is a wretched Creature, which revolts againſt his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by an enormous Ingratitude which he commits againſt his Benefactor; from the Hatred God bears to Sin, by the horrible Puniſhments he lays upon it, in Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Angels, in Earth upon Men, and by what he heaps upon the Damned in Hell, which he will cauſe to continue for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; And in fine, from the Juſtice and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction he exacted from his own Son,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:33523:288"/>who alone was able to ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice for the infinite Injury Sin had done to God.</p>
               <p>The Damage Sin brings to the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that it miſerably robs her of the Grace of God, it deprives her of the Right ſhe had to Paradiſe; it makes her a Slave of the Devil, and ſubject to Eternal Damnation.</p>
               <p>All theſe things ſeriouſly conſider'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in the Soul a Hatred and Deteſtation of Sin, a Sorrow and Regret for having committed it, an ardent Will to do Penance for it, and a conſtant Reſolution for the future to fly from that Monſter, and by ſerving God faithfully, to avoid the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of Miſeries.</p>
               <p>As to Vices in particular, we ponder the Reaſons and Motives which oblige to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew them, which are many and moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, we endeavor to convince the Mind to fly from them entirely, and to confirm our ſelves in the Reſolution of ſhunning them; from thence we Meditate on the Means to put them in practice.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be us'd in reſpect of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, we examin the Motives which render them amiable, we ſtir up our ſelves to love and embrace them, we ſeek the Means to acquire them, foreſee the Obſtacles which may be found therein to avoid them, the Occaſions we ſhall have to practiſe them, and other like things.</p>

               <head>ARTICLE XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Another eaſie and profitable Subject of Meditation.</head>
               <p>You will find all the former Subjects in divers Books of Meditation, which are made expreſly for that intent; but to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate yet more the Uſe of this holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, there is a Way which ſeems to me more commodious, and which may be very beneficial to you.</p>
               <p>It is to take a Book of Devotion, and to make uſe of each Chapter for the Matter of one or more Meditations. You may profitably employ in this Buſineſs, the Book of the Imitation of Chriſt, the great Guide and Memorial of <hi>Granado,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to a Devout Life, and many other good Books.</p>
               <p>But not to ſend you farther, you may eaſily advantage your ſelf by this Book of the Inſtruction of Youth, and gather from thence much profit. There is ſcarce any Chapter which contains not the three Acts of Meditation, that is, Conſiderations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject, and afterwards Affections and Reſolutions rais'd from thence, or at leaſt it is eaſie to draw them from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which are there treated.</p>
               <p>So that taking a Chapter to Meditate on, you may firſt make choice of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Conſiderations you will Meditate on, and afterwards having plac'd your ſelf in the Preſence of God, and begg'd of him
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:33523:289"/>the Light of his Grace, revolve in your Mind theſe Conſiderations, read them, and weigh them attentively; then draw from thence Affections agreeable to the Matter, and form neceſſary Reſolutions; and in fine, after you have well digeſted them in your Mind, and are ſufficiently confirm'd in them, demand of God the Grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and practiſe them. This is a manner of Meditation which ſeems to me facil, and which may be very profitable.</p>
               <p>To facilitate this yet more, I will ſet you down here ſome Examples.</p>
               <p>If you ſhall deſire to Meditate on the firſt Chapter of the Book, which is of the End for which Man is created, read atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively the whole Chapter, you will find in it three Reflections upon Man, or upon your ſelf, What you are, Who made you what you are, And for what End he hath made you. You will ſee there, that this End is nothing leſs than God himſelf, who would give himſelf to you to poſſeſs him perfectly; and this not for a ſhort time, but for all Eternity. You will ſee there how great this End is, how amiable, and how ardently you ought to deſire it. Theſe Conſiderations will ſtir you up to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge on one ſide, the immenſe Goodneſs of God towards you; and on the other ſide, the horrible Blindneſs of Men, and your own alſo, who think ſo little on ſo noble and bleſſed an End, and put your ſelf often in danger of loſing it without recovery. You will afterwards find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:33523:289"/>to make upon your ſelf, as well for what's paſt as for the future, and the Reſolutions you ought to make upon ſo important a Subject.</p>
               <p>In the Second Chapter, which treats of the Vocation to Chriſtianity, you will find how much this vaſt Benefit of God obliges you to ſerve him. 1. By the greatneſs of this Grace, upon which you will obſerve three Reflections, which will furniſh you to make one, or many very profitable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. 2. By the great Obligation of Chriſtianity, which being well conſider'd, will effectually excite you to acquit your ſelf of it as you ought.</p>
               <p>Continuing thus thro' every Chapter of the Firſt Part, you will find in them wherewith to entertain your Mind profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably before God, and wherewith to ſtir your ſelf up, and reſolve to ſerve him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>In the Second Part you will take notice of the Means which are neceſſary for you to attain to Vertue. There is no Chapter which will not furniſh you with Matter whereon to Meditate, and which will not raiſe in you powerful Conſiderations to perſuade you to love them, and put them in practice. Meditate on them in this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is, in the Deſign to convince your ſelf of the practice of the Means, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue on this Subject until ſuch time as you find in your ſelf the Effect of this Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The Third Part ſpeaks to you of the
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:33523:290"/>Obſtacles of Salvation, that is, of Vices, which you ought to avoid. Upon every Vice you will find firſt the Motives which oblige you to fly from them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Means you muſt uſe for that End. Read both of them attentively upon each Obſtacle, the Firſt to inſtruct you, and convince your Mind, the Second to put them in practice. Meditate on them in the Preſence of God, with deſign to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage your ſelf by them. Obſerve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Order we have given, and you will find that it will not be perform'd without profit.</p>
               <p>You will find the ſame in the Fourth Part, which treats of Vertues neceſſary for young People. The Motives are ſtill there mention'd, and afterward the Means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them. If you read them with never ſo little attention, you will find that there is no Subject or Matter of Meditation more eaſie, as it is one of the moſt uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>The Laſt Part of the Book, which treats of the Choice of a State of Life, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you whereon to Meditate, when you ſhall be upon the point of that Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You will there find the importance of the Choice, the Faults you muſt avoid therein, the Means you muſt employ in it, divers Conſiderations upon each State, and other things of conſequence. All this will afford you both profitable and neceſſary Matter of Meditation.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Practice of Meditation.</head>
               <p>To reduce into Practice all that we have ſaid of Meditation, ſee here what you ſhall do. Firſt, As the Morning is the moſt commodious time for the Exerciſes of the Mind, take that to make your Meditation in, following the Advice of the Wiſeman, who ſays,<note n="a" place="margin">Cor ſuum tradet ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilandum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luculo ad Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum qui fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit illum, &amp; in conſpectu al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimi depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabitur. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 39.</note> 
                  <hi>The Juſt will apply his Heart in the Morning to think upon God his Creator, and to Pray in the Preſence of the moſt High;</hi> and many other Paſſages of Scripture which recommend<note n="b" place="bottom">In matutinis meditabor in te. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.

               <p>From this very Day read the Subject you will Meditate on. In the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after you have ador'd Almighty God, and offer'd to him your Ordinary Prayers, read again the ſame Matter. Afterwards caſting your ſelf upon your Knees in the Preſence of God, beg of him the Grace to perform well this Meditation, and to learn therein, and keep in mind ſome important Truths for your Salvation.</p>
               <p>Preſent your ſelf to him as a blind Man, who deſires to have his Sight reſtor'd.<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>18.</hi>

Or as an infirm Man, who ſeeks the Remedies of his Soul. <hi>Miſerere mei, Domine, anima mea malè à Daemonio vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi> Have pity, O God, on my Soul, which is perſecuted by the Enemies of her Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You ſhall make uſe of ſome of theſe, or ſuch like Prayers.</p>
               <p>Afterwards apply your Mind to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Subject you are to Meditate on; chooſe two or three of thoſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which you ſhall find in your Book, fix your Thought upon each, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to weigh them, to convince your ſelf of them, and to keep them in your Mind.</p>
               <p>But ſettle moſt of all your Heart and Affection thereon, to ſtir up your ſelf to love, to embrace, and to practiſe the Truths you Meditate on; for this is the Fruit and End of Meditation. We Meditate not to underſtand the good, but to love it, and put it in Execution; We ſeek not after Science but Vertue.</p>
               <pb n="563" facs="tcp:33523:291"/>
               <p>For this reaſon you muſt pauſe longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Affections and Reſolutions, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Conſiderations; you muſt enlarge them, entertain them, and reliſh them at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For Example, it doth not ſuffice to conſider in Meditation how amiable God is, to repreſent the Reaſons of it, as his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Perfections, his Favors; but after having made theſe Conſiderations, you muſt deſcend to the Affections thereof, to love him actually, and ſay from your Heart, It is true, O God, that thou art infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, and that there are infinite Reaſons to love thee, why ſhould I not then perform it? Why ſhall I be ſo obdurate, ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſuch an Enemy to my ſelf, as not to have a Love for thee? O God, how misfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate is he who loves thee not! and how miſerable was I when I lov'd thee not! and inſtead of bearing thee a Kindneſs, was wedded to my Paſſions and Pleaſures! I have lov'd thee too late, O infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! I have lov'd thee too late! but now I will love thee moſt perfectly; nothing ſhall ſeparate me from thy Love, from thy Service, from thy Obedience.</p>
               <p>It is chiefly in this place of Affections, where God ſpeaks to the Heart by good Motions, which he beſtows upon it: It is there, where finding the Soul in a holy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and thinking on nothing but him, he is pleas'd to ſpeak to her interiorly, and repleniſh her with his Love.<note n="a" place="margin">Ducam eam in ſolitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; loquar ad cor ejus. <hi>Oſeae.</hi> 2.</note>

                  <hi>Speak, Lord, for thy Servant hears thee.</hi> Let not Men now talk to me, let not Books inſtruct me at this time; but thou, O Lord, do me the Favor to ſpeak interiorly to me, and touch my Heart, and fill it with thy Love.</p>
               <p>Continue a while in this State, and in theſe pious Affections which God ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon you, ſtirring them up, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining them the beſt you can; apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them one while to the Hatred of Sin, to the Fear of God and his Judgments; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while to a deſire to ſerve God, to become Vertuous, to fly the Occaſions of Sin, and ſtrongly reſiſt Temptations; but moſt frequently to the Love of God, to an Affection for Chriſtian Vertues, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Chaſtity, Temperance, and other pious and wholſom Affections, as the Matter of your Meditation ſhall direct.</p>
               <p>But chiefly, forget not to come to good Reſolutions; for it would be to offer a great Injury to God, to have receiv'd from him good Motions, and not to put them in
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:33523:292"/>Execution. Wherefore you muſt always conclude your Meditation with firm Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, to practiſe the Good with which God hath inſpir'd you in Prayer. But this Reſolution muſt be ſtrong and efficacious, let it therefore be follow'd by its Effect; and that it may be ſuch, read and practiſe the Third and Fourth Advice which you will find in the following Article.</p>
               <p>Finiſh your Prayer by giving Thanks to God for the good Thoughts and Motions he hath beſtow'd upon you, and in humbly begging of him the Grace to put them in practice; foreſee the occaſion you may have to practiſe them, that you may be mindful of them.</p>
               <p>You may perform this Exerciſe in a large quarter of an hour; that time is not too long for an Action of ſuch importance, where you treat with God concerning your Salvation, and wherein God do's you the Honor to hearken to you, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf to you with ſo much Bounty.</p>
               <p>As for the Days of Meditation, it would be a great Bleſſing for you, if you could perform it every Day: In expecting that Bleſſing, endeavor to perform it at leaſt every <hi>Sunday</hi> and Feaſt, on the Days of Confeſſion and Communion, and alſo on ſome Days before to prepare your ſelf for it, and ſome Days after to conſerve the Fruit of it; I add alſo the Days wherein you ſhall find your ſelf mov'd with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, that in this Exerciſe you may find Arms to defend your ſelf, according to

               <head type="sub">Some Advices concerning Meditation.</head>
               <p>Before the finiſhing of this Treatiſe, there remain ſome Advices to be given you, to prevent the Difficulties which will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in this holy Exerciſe, and to make it ſolidly profitable to you.</p>
               <div n="1" type="advice">
                  <head>ADVICE I.</head>
                  <p>The Firſt is, That you diligently take care, not to permit your Mind to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd with any falſe Opinion againſt Meditation, as to conceive that you are not capable of Meditating, or that it is too much trouble, or not neceſſary, or the like.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt Obſtacle the Devil will put in your way, to divert you entirely from this Exerciſe; but we have already before taken notice of this Impediment, and diſcover'd the vanity of that Illuſion, in the Eight Firſt Articles, wherefore read them attentively.</p>
                  <p>And chiefly concerning the Capacity, remember, that it is not your great Wit,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:33523:293"/>nor your high Studies, which make you capable of Meditating, but Humility, and the knowledge of your own Diſability to think or do any good Actions, and the great Deſire to profit in Vertue. Theſe are the Diſpoſitions which render you capable of Meditating, or rather of receiving the Lights and Motions of Divine Grace, which are the things we ſeek in Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not our proper Imaginations.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="advice">
                  <head>ADVICE II.</head>
                  <p>The Second Advice is, Not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd with the Difficulties you may find in this Exerciſe, as the trouble to apply your Mind, Diſtractions, Diſtaſts, and the like.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Repreſent to your ſelf, that good things are not acquir'd without pains. How much is there in Studies, and other Exerciſes of Human Life, from which yet we deſiſt not by reaſon of that Difficulty?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, that all Beginnings are difficult, and that by Exerciſe they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, and chiefly by the Grace of God, which is the firſt Mover to all good things, but particularly in this Action, where it is the prime and principal ſupport.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Make theſe Diſtractions ſerve for your Meditation, and proceed in this manner. Humble your ſelf in the ſight of God, becauſe you cannot keep your Mind attentive: Acknowledge that it is thro' your Fault, That your Sins are the cauſe, That this ſprings from your Lightneſs, and
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:33523:294"/>from the too much inclination you have to the Vanities and Pleaſures of the World. Take from thence occaſion to lament your Sins, to demand pardon of God for them, to purpoſe to fly from them for the future, to correct the Levity of your Mind, and to redreſs your diſorderly Affections.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Amongſt all theſe Diſtractions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count your ſelf as a Beggar at the Gate of God, from whom you beg an Alms. Doth a Beggar eſteem himſelf repuls'd, becauſe he is not hearkned to at his firſt Requeſt? He continues ſoliciting, he expects, he comes again. Act you in that manner, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, humbly<note n="a" place="margin">Si vis habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re juſtitiam Dei, eſto men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus Dei, qui te monuit ut peteres. <hi>S. Aug. Ser.</hi> 5. <hi>de verb. Dom.</hi>
                     </note> begging of God a good Thought for your Salvation. Altho' you ſhould ſpend all the time of your Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Demand, you would not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd much. Call to mind that excellent Sentence of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who ſays, That<note n="b" place="margin">Cum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius dat Deus, commendat dona non ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat; diu deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derata dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us obtinentur; citius data vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcunt. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>when God do's not preſently grant the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we deſire, it is not becauſe he refuſes us, but becauſe he would have us ſet ſuch a value on his Favors as they deſerve;</hi> It being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that we more eſteem the things we obtain with much trouble, and make leſs account of thoſe we acquire without pains. For this reaſon he adds,<note n="c" place="margin">Pete, quaere, inſta, ſervat cibi Deus quod non vult cito dare, ut diſcas magna magne deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Ask, ſeek, urge; God reſerves the Favor to grant it at the end, altho' he would not conſent to it at the firſt, that you might learn to ſolicit for great things with an ardent deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. In theſe Occaſions behave your ſelf like the poor <hi>Cananean,</hi> who gain'd by her admirable Patience, the Favor which the
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:33523:294"/>Son of God had refus'd her. This Woman being afflicted, came, and caſt her ſelf at the Feet of our Lord, to obtain the cure of her Daughter tormented with a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirit. He paſſes on his Way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anſwering her one word. She addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes her ſelf to the Apoſtles, who intercede for her, but to no purpoſe. Seeing her ſelf thus rejected, ſhe puts her ſelf forward, and preſents her ſelf to him again with more inſtance than before, O Lord, aſſiſt me! He anſwers roughly, That it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to take the Bread of the Children to caſt it to the Dogs; An Anſwer ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to repulſe a moſt approv'd Patience. She inſtead of being dejected by it, takes advantage from his Words, and makes uſe of them to obtain the Effect of her Prayer; Ah Lord! pardon me if I tell you, that ſometimes Bread is given to the Dogs, for at leaſt they are permitted to eat the Crums which fall from their Maſter's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: I alſo demand nothing more than the remainder of the Favors you ſhew to your Children. Our Lord took ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in ſeeing the Faith, Humility, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of this afflicted Perſon, that praiſing her highly, he ſaid to her, <hi>O Woman, great is thy Faith, be it to thee as thou deſireſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Imitate in your Prayer this admirable Example, and ſtill when you beg of God any Grace for your Salvation, altho' God anſwer you not by ſome good Thoughts, continue intreating, <hi>Domine, adjuva me, Lord, aſſiſt me.</hi> Have recourſe to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:33523:295"/>of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of the Saints, as the <hi>Cananean</hi> to that of the Apoſtles. If theſe Coldneſſes chancing to continue, your Conſcience tell you, that they are your Sins which are the cauſe, and that they render you unworthy of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors you requeſt; Acknowledge humbly the truth, and declaring that it is ſo, ſay from your Heart as the <hi>Cananean,</hi> It is true, O God, it is not reaſonable that thou ſhouldſt give the Bread of thy Children to Dogs, that is, to Sinners, ſuch as I am; but at leaſt, as the Crums of Bread which fall from the Table are allow'd to the Dogs, deny me not thoſe which fall from thine; grant me ſome ſmall remainder of thoſe abundant Graces which thou poureſt upon thoſe who faithfully ſerve thee. If you perſevere thus, God will grant your Petition, and recompence your Faith, your Humility, and your Patience. And altho' he ſhould give you no good Thoughts at all upon the Subject you would Meditate, that Patience, that Humility, that ſtedfaſt Faith which you exerciſe, will be more pleaſing to him than any thing elſe, and more profitable to you, and this will be the beſt Fruit of your Prayer. Thus, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> you ſhall loſe nothing; for in ſeeking God on one ſide, you will find him on the other; and you will experience the truth of that excellent Obſervation made by the great St. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Dico tibi ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus eſt Deus qui fruſtra nunquam quaeri poteſt, nec etiam cum inveniri non poteſt. <hi>S. Bern. l.</hi> 5. <hi>de Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. c.</hi> 11.</note> 
                     <hi>That amongſt all the things we ſeek for, only God is never ſought for in vain, even when we imagin we cannot find him.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="advice">
                  <pb n="571" facs="tcp:33523:295"/>
                  <head>ADVICE. III.</head>
                  <p>The Third Advice is, That in every Meditation you ſtill be mindful of the End for which you Meditate, which is the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of your Soul, and to make you really vertuous in the ſight of God; ſo that the Meditation which doth not improve you, is not a Meditation nor Prayer, but a Speculative Study, which is ſometimes more prejudicial than profitable.</p>
                  <p>The Meditation which is perform'd without a proſpect of this End, is full of an infinite number of moſt dangerous Defects. It makes us ſtop at the Thoughts, and not at the Affections; at the ſubtil Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not at the ſolid; at thoſe which delight the Mind, and not at thoſe which move the Heart. If we paſs to Affections, it is to thoſe which are found moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and not to thoſe which are moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, ſuch as the hatred of Sin, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of mortifying our Paſſions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting our Vices. We content our ſelves with the Affection, and omit the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and if we proceed to Reſolutions, we content our ſelves with general ones, without deſcending to Particulars. For Example, we ſay, I would be Humble, Chaſt, Temperate; but we do not ſay, I will be Humble in that Occaſion, I will O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey when I ſhall be Commanded, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg my Fault when I ſhall be Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and other like; I will be Chaſt by reſiſting Temptations, thro' ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:33523:296"/>Means; I will avoid ſuch Occaſions, which are dangerous for me; I will ſhun Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. And in fine, if we come to ſome particular Reſolutions, we make them but weakly, and not with force and vigor; from whence it comes to paſs that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh them not, and ſo they are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable as if they were not made at all.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Faults in Meditation ſpring from the firſt, that we propoſe not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in Meditating the Sanctification of our Soul, by the ſolid Practice of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>From hence it comes, that this manner of Meditation prejudices more than it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, becauſe it is apt to give to thoſe who act thus, a very good Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a Contempt of others, and a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their Merits: It makes them much addicted to their own Judgment and Will, and believe they are Saints by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on holy things, altho' they practiſe them not, which is a very great Miſchief, not only to them, but to others, who take from thence an occaſion to blame Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Devotion, whereas they are not the cauſe of theſe Diſorders, but the ill uſe theſe Perſons make of them.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon, <hi>Theotime,</hi> when you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your ſelf to this holy Exerciſe, propoſe to your ſelf ſtrongly that End, to make your ſelf Vertuous, and believe that that Meditation is unprofitable, from which you depart without a particular Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of correcting your ſelf, and of loving God, more than you have done as yet.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="advice">
                  <pb n="573" facs="tcp:33523:296"/>
                  <head>ADVICE IV.</head>
                  <p>But it is not ſufficient to refer Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the practice of Vertue, we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be careful to relate it to the practice of the moſt ſolid Vertues, as Faith, Humility, the Love of God and our Neighbor, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, Temperance, and others; and chiefly thoſe we have moſt need of in the preſent State wherein we find our ſelves, and whoſe Occaſions occur moſt frequently.</p>
                  <p>This Advice is one of the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant which can be given in this Matter; for to what purpoſe is it to propoſe to our ſelves in Meditating, fair and apparent Vertues, and in the mean time omit the more ſolid, which are the Groundwork and Foundation of all others, and which making leſs ſhew, are notwithſtanding more neceſſary? To what end, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, do we propoſe to our ſelves to be very liberal to the Poor, if we had Means, to ſuffer great Perſecutions for Gods ſake, if they ſhould befall us, with other like things, and neglect the Vertues we ſtand in preſent want of, as Chaſtity, Humility, Meekneſs toward our Neighbor; or thoſe which we have every Day occaſion to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, as the mortifying our Paſſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining our Anger, ſuffering our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, obeying our Superiors?</p>
                  <p>In a word, Meditation is a Means to ſanctifie our Souls. This Sanctification conſiſts in moderating our Paſſions, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting our Vices, and by conſequence, in
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:33523:297"/>acquiring the contrary Vertues: It ought therefore to be neceſſarily referr'd to that End, and to produce that Effect; otherwiſe it is not a Meditation, but a pure Illuſion: And thoſe who make uſe of it ſo, abuſe the moſt holy and wholſom thing, which they render unprofitable to themſelves, and contemptible to others.</p>
                  <p>Act not in this manner, <hi>Theotime,</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate really to ſanctifie your Soul, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your Paſſions, to correct the Vices which bear dominion in you, to practiſe true and ſolid Vertues, and thoſe you ſtand in moſt need of in your preſent State.</p>

               <head>CONCL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SION.</head>
               <p>This is what I had to propoſe to you upon this Subject of Meditation. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I have but two Words to ſay to you, <hi>Read,</hi> and <hi>Practiſe.</hi> Read, to inſtruct your ſelf in a thing which as yet you know not, to convince your ſelf that Meditation is not ſo difficult as you might conceive it, but that you may practiſe it, and that it may be very beneficial to you. Read, to learn the Method of it, and practiſe the ſame. But content not your ſelf with the Reading, proceed to the Practice and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſo pious a thing. Try what you can do therein, or rather what God will give you the Grace to perform: Be aſſur'd he will give you much, if you approach to it with a ſincere Intention to pleaſe him, and to learn in that Divine School the
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:33523:297"/>Truths of your Salvation, and to practiſe them faithfully. Be not diſmay'd for the Difficulties, be faithful and perſeverant, and God will beſtow upon you the Means to ſurmount them. Call to mind that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Prophet, That<note n="a" place="margin">Bonus eſt Dominus ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantibus in ſe animae quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renti illum. <hi>Thren.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>God is good to thoſe who hope in him, and to Souls which in reality ſearch after him.</hi> Seek after him in your Prayers and Meditations, and you will find him, if you ſearch faithfully.<note n="b" place="margin">Petite &amp; accipietis, quaerite, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be granted to you; ſeek, and you ſhall find; knock at the Door, and it ſhall be open'd to you.</hi>

                  <hi>Taſt,</hi> Theotime, <hi>and experience, how ſweet and pleaſant God is,</hi> in this pious Exerciſe, <hi>and you will find by experience,</hi> and in effect, the truth of that Sentence of the Divine Wiſdom,<note n="d" place="margin">Beatus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo qui audit me, qui vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat ad fores meas quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, &amp; obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat ad poſtes oſtii mei.

                  <hi>Bleſſed is he who hears me, and who watches often at my Door, and waits at my Gates. He who ſhall find me ſhall find Life, and receive Salvation from the Hand of our Lord.</hi>
